0.01061775509054579,"the other new business item is something that afge has proposed, which is to review the federal wage system appropriated and nonappropriated fund operating manuals, which i think is an interesting and in many ways good idea, but since the afge members are not here, we probably ought to just kick that can down the road too."
0.010507977223750188,"and i just want to report briefly that i attended, just in the audience, an event that was sponsored by the partnership for public service on june 13th, a federal pay debate, which featured several of the folks who have done pay comparability studies, federal, non-federal, this fellow andrew biggs from american enterprise institute, somebody representing the cbo, and also rex facer, a member of the federal salary council."
0.010492922451077793,"it might also be useful to have guidance about priority, the order in which we address them in the working group, if anyone has thoughts about that, and if not, we will just move on to new business."
0.010490671011348256,"i believe we had decided that all these items would be discussed in the working group, unless there's some comments here that people want to make about any of them."
0.0104891119584411,"i would agree that it might not be necessary or advisable to move forward on these two new agenda items at the committee meeting today, since we already are going to be considering the usefulness of the regulatory criterion for msas as they apply to areas of application, but if everybody wants to move forward with these today at this committee, that's fine."
0.010482190495054788,"if not, my suggestion would be to refer them to the working group, because there's a similar issue already there, and the general question of what to do about this long-standing regulation is something that is on the table in the working group."
0.010441433922304042,"i had a brief conversation with jacque a couple of weeks ago about some questions that she received that were not covered in the appropriated fund operating manual or were insufficiently covered, but i haven't heard what the exact proposals would be for adding something to the operating manuals or whether it might be more appropriate to add something to regulation."
0.010374115412791651,"so once we do have something before us, you can take a look at it and see what the appropriate way of handling would be, with the committee's advice."

0.010267267962856777,"we thought we'd have them by today, but it looks like it will be our next meeting, perhaps, before we will be able to share them."
0.01024558896002563,people might find it of some use to take a look at that.
0.010242675594446256,"i just wanted to make note of a new member of the wage staff, appropriated fund side."
0.010241846640150307,"so we will keep the committee informed about what's going on with this, but it's possible that it might be resolved without opm's or the committees need for further involvement."
0.010150597826509478,so if i could ask mark to first summarize for us item a.
0.010144345937923347,"it was an interesting session, and people who want to learn more about this whole sort of debate and controversy might be interested in taking a look at the web link or i believe they videotaped the event."
0.010126147600317185,"a response to his letter is winding its way through our system, and we'll share that once it's finally cleared."

0.010050504676604826,"and so people will probably hear about it when it comes out, but i just want to give folks a heads-up."
0.010044082390228228,"please let me know the end result of this issue, since master hanrahan contacted me for help."
0.010025595783828936,but i would also note we don't have a quorum.
0.010022746369014514,"now, i would like to call on jerry to see if there is any update on the draft proposed regulation to consolidate fws wage areas."
0.010021435674487024,"i thought he did a pretty good job in actual fact, but i think his remarks were rather badly distorted in the federal times."
0.009990786366282351,"have people had a chance to review them, and are there any further corrections or changes?"
0.009983951003677246,"next item, under 575-oc-5, we got a large batch of letters from fws workers at tobyhanna, i think in the vicinity of 400 letters."
0.009978306926189706,"the government accountability office is working on a report on federal pay comparability, which i believe will be released to the public very soon, if it hasn't already."
0.009973874424693859,"i know we have a rather lightly attended meeting today, but i guess let's just forge ahead."
0.009933985497059292,"well, i guess we will just defer any further action on those, since we don't really have a quorum."
0.009902871130215,"if not, we can begin our working group meeting in 10 minutes in the small pendleton room."

0.00986205221429466,"it's not been part of the federal wage system since the federal wage system was created, but the set-aside wage schedule was allowed to continue, and the rates on the wage schedule are making it difficult to recruit and retain sufficient personnel to staff the vessel in a manner that master hanrahan believes is safe."
0.009855790889647121,"well, unless there's some objection -- well, is there any other new business?"

0.009189197335329422,so in view of that --
