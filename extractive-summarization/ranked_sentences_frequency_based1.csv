"if we can address them by consensus in here, that is great.",1.375
"i can introduce them, anyways, just quickly.",1.375
"so, anyway, enough of that.",1.5
motion seconded.,1.5
it appears that the easiest and best way to do that is to scan them and put them on a cd.,1.6875
yes.,1.75
so we couldnt actually adopt these?,1.875
"good morning, everyone.",1.875
"mr. gary kistner, who introduced himself up front, has taken over for karl fendt in his analyst role.",1.9583333333333333
"somewhere else in our building, i think.",2.1
"there are a bunch of announcements on the agenda, and you have the documents pertaining to the announcements in your folder and should have received them electronically ahead of time.",2.125
"it has not yet been released, but --",2.125
"regulation tends to be more permanent, because of the administrative procedures act public comment period.",2.1363636363636362
is there a motion to adjourn?,2.1666666666666665
motion to adjourn.,2.1666666666666665
the ranks of master and captain are similar.,2.3

madeline is researching that issue.,2.375
"hearing no objection, we are adjourned.",2.375
"she had an advancement opportunity at the department of homeland security, which she took advantage of, and she started there this week.",2.409090909090909

he was on the naf side of the house until a couple weeks ago.,2.5625

"the vessel transports both passengers and cargo to and from the isle royale national park in lake superior, and mr. hanrahan raises an issue concerning the members of his crew, who are   fws employees.",2.675
"there was not much of an opportunity to rebut the positions of the aei fellow or even respond adequately to the cbo, but it was an interesting event.",2.7
"i know we have a rather lightly attended meeting today, but i guess let's just forge ahead.",2.772727272727273
ann marie hannon was the va representative.,2.7857142857142856

so we will address that next time.,2.875
"presumably, it will wind its way to us at some point.",2.9166666666666665
i think that the rank of master is sort of like a captain but i'm not sure.,2.9375
"well, i guess we will just defer any further action on those, since we don't really have a quorum.",2.9444444444444446
"the next item is the final annual summary for 2011 that we approved at our april meeting, and so you have the final version in your folder.",3.0384615384615383

"i had a brief conversation with jacque a couple of weeks ago about some questions that she received that were not covered in the appropriated fund operating manual or were insufficiently covered, but i haven't heard what the exact proposals would be for adding something to the operating manuals or whether it might be more appropriate to add something to regulation.",3.05
"i thought he did a pretty good job in actual fact, but i think his remarks were rather badly distorted in the federal times.",3.1
"unless there's some objection, we will adopt those minutes.",3.1
i just want to recognize febbie.,3.125
"and so people will probably hear about it when it comes out, but i just want to give folks a heads-up.",3.1875
so if i could ask mark to first summarize for us item a.,3.1875
the department of the interior headquarters staff is currently working with the national park service staff to figure out what the best pay approach is for the crew of the vessel.,3.2058823529411766
"i also received a letter from a mr. william hanrahan, who is master of the usnps ranger iii vessel.",3.227272727272727
thank you.,3.25
"it is something that was requested by representative issa, i believe, last march or thereabouts.",3.25
good luck to you in your new endeavor.,3.3
but i would also note we don't have a quorum.,3.3
"unless there is any further -- yes, sir?",3.3
"and i just want to report briefly that i attended, just in the audience, an event that was sponsored by the partnership for public service on june 13th, a federal pay debate, which featured several of the folks who have done pay comparability studies, federal, non-federal, this fellow andrew biggs from american enterprise institute, somebody representing the cbo, and also rex facer, a member of the federal salary council.",3.3214285714285716
people might find it of some use to take a look at that.,3.357142857142857
"i guess just two other quick announcements, while i've got this captive audience.",3.388888888888889
"that brings up old business items, of which we have five.",3.4166666666666665
"please let me know the end result of this issue, since master hanrahan contacted me for help.",3.423076923076923
"we thought we'd have them by today, but it looks like it will be our next meeting, perhaps, before we will be able to share them.",3.5
"so we will keep the committee informed about what's going on with this, but it's possible that it might be resolved without opm's or the committees need for further involvement.",3.5357142857142856
"the first one is director berry's responses to several letters, one from representative runyan, one from afge president gage, and the letter from the fprac labor members.",3.6052631578947367
"if not, we can begin our working group meeting in 10 minutes in the small pendleton room.",3.75
"next item, under 575-oc-5, we got a large batch of letters from fws workers at tobyhanna, i think in the vicinity of 400 letters.",3.8214285714285716
"so once we do have something before us, you can take a look at it and see what the appropriate way of handling would be, with the committee's advice.",3.892857142857143
"continuing on to the next item, under 575-act-1, the folks at act have beaten amazon.com to the punch and put our working group report on their web page, so we have that to report.",3.9
"the government accountability office is working on a report on federal pay comparability, which i believe will be released to the public very soon, if it hasn't already.",3.90625

"it was an interesting session, and people who want to learn more about this whole sort of debate and controversy might be interested in taking a look at the web link or i believe they videotaped the event.",3.9761904761904763
"terry garnett sent us a letter with the link, which i have shared with you, if anybody is interested in an electronic copy of that working group report.",4.033333333333333
"mr. chairman, it's possible that this may not actually be an issue for the committee's attention.",4.055555555555555
he is concerned about the pay disparity issue between wage grade and general schedule employees who work at the same location but are paid as if they are in two different locations.,4.09375
thank you for joining us.,4.125
"i would like to report that the proposed regulations have cleared through the opm program offices that ordinarily clear regulations, and they now reside with the director of opm.",4.15625
"it might also be useful to have guidance about priority, the order in which we address them in the working group, if anyone has thoughts about that, and if not, we will just move on to new business.",4.15625
okay.,4.25
that brings us up to the minutes of our april meeting.,4.583333333333333
"i would agree that it might not be necessary or advisable to move forward on these two new agenda items at the committee meeting today, since we already are going to be considering the usefulness of the regulatory criterion for msas as they apply to areas of application, but if everybody wants to move forward with these today at this committee, that's fine.",4.602941176470588
"the other new business item is something that afge has proposed, which is to review the federal wage system appropriated and nonappropriated fund operating manuals, which i think is an interesting and in many ways good idea, but since the afge members are not here, we probably ought to just kick that can down the road too.",4.65
"well, okay.",4.833333333333333
it may be of some interest to this audience.,4.9
"the incoming letters, i think you have from previous meetings.",4.916666666666667
"alexander, burke, caldwell, and catawba counties, north carolina, comprise the hickory-lenoir-morganton, north carolina, msa, and that msa is currently split between asheville, north carolina, and charlotte, north carolina, wage areas.",4.978260869565218
we are working out the logistics of how to share those with the members of the committee.,5.083333333333333
"now, i would like to call on jerry to see if there is any update on the draft proposed regulation to consolidate fws wage areas.",5.1
"this is his first and certainly not his last fprac meeting, so i want everyone to know who he is.",5.125
"if not, my suggestion would be to refer them to the working group, because there's a similar issue already there, and the general question of what to do about this long-standing regulation is something that is on the table in the working group.",5.138888888888889
"the youngstown-warren-boardman, ohio- pennsylvania msa is split between the cleveland, oh, and pittsburgh, pa, wage areas.",5.15
"and again, as with the previous case, that entire msa under opm's regulatory criterion currently should be combined under just one wage area.",5.1923076923076925
"under new business, definition of hickory-lenoir-morganton, north carolina, msa 575-mgt-1.",5.214285714285714
"i believe we had decided that all these items would be discussed in the working group, unless there's some comments here that people want to make about any of them.",5.392857142857143
"it's not been part of the federal wage system since the federal wage system was created, but the set-aside wage schedule was allowed to continue, and the rates on the wage schedule are making it difficult to recruit and retain sufficient personnel to staff the vessel in a manner that master hanrahan believes is safe.",5.421875
"well, unless there's some objection -- well, is there any other new business?",5.4375
"under opm's regulatory criterion, unless there's some exceptional reason for having the msa split, all the counties should be combined under one wage area.",5.535714285714286
"under 575-mgt-1, the management members recommend that alexander and catawba counties be redefined to the asheville wage areas area of application.",5.576923076923077
all of these letters pertain to the proposal to combine fws wage areas that lie inside of gs locality pay areas.,5.75
are there any other items people want to bring up?,5.75
the current pay system approach for the vessel is that it's a set-aside wage schedule.,5.8125
"i just wanted to make note of a new member of the wage staff, appropriated fund side.",5.863636363636363
"under 575-mgt-2, we have a management recommendation to move mercer county to the cleveland wage areas area of application.",6.045454545454546
"under new business, we have two issues, both of which involve the regulation that msas should not be split between federal wage system wage areas except   in very unusual circumstances.",6.694444444444445
this is my first meeting as well.,6.7
this is her last meeting with us.,6.9
