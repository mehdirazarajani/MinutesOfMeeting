"CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN said ""I know we have a rather lightly attended meeting today, but I guess let's just forge ahead. There are a bunch of announcements on the agenda, and you have the documents pertaining to the announcements in your folder and should have received them electronically ahead of time. The first one is Director Berry's responses to several letters, one from Representative Runyan, one from AFGE president Gage, and the letter from the FPRAC Labor members. All of these letters pertain to the proposal to combine FWS wage areas that lie inside of GS locality pay areas. The incoming letters, I think you have from previous meetings. The next item is the final Annual Summary for 2011 that we approved at our April meeting, and so you have the final version in your folder. I received a memorandum from a Colonel James Ross regarding FWS workers at the New Boston Air Force Station in New Hampshire. He is concerned about the pay disparity issue between Wage Grade and General Schedule employees who work at the same location but are paid as if they are in two different locations. A response to his letter is winding its way through our system, and we'll share that once it's finally cleared. I also received a letter from a Mr. William Hanrahan, who is Master of the USNPS Ranger III vessel.

"CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN said ""It is anticipated soon. And so people will probably hear about it when it comes out, but I just want to give folks a heads-up. It is something that was requested by Representative Issa, I believe, last March or thereabouts. And I just want to report briefly that I attended, just in the audience, an event that was sponsored by the Partnership for Public Service on June 13th, a Federal pay debate, which featured several of the folks who have done pay comparability studies, Federal, non-Federal, this fellow Andrew Biggs from American Enterprise Institute, somebody representing the CBO, and also Rex Facer, a member of the Federal Salary Council. And I felt badly for Rex. I thought he did a pretty good job in actual fact, but I think his remarks were rather badly distorted in the Federal Times. It was an interesting session, and people who want to learn more about this whole sort of debate and controversy might be interested in taking a look at the Web link or I believe they videotaped the event. There was not much of an opportunity to rebut the positions of the AEI fellow or even respond adequately to the CBO, but it was an interesting event. People might find it of some use to take a look at that. So, anyway, enough of that. That brings us up to the minutes of our April meeting. Have people had a chance to review them, and are there any further corrections or changes? Okay. Unless there's some objection, we will adopt those minutes. Hearing none, the minutes are adopted. That brings up old business items, of which we have five. I believe we had decided that all these items would be discussed in the working group, unless there's some comments here that people want to make about any of them. It might also be useful to have guidance about priority, the order in which we address them in the working group, if anyone has thoughts about that, and if not, we will just move on to new business. Okay. Under new business, we have two issues, both of which involve the regulation that MSAs should not be split between Federal Wage System wage areas except   in very unusual circumstances. If we can address them by consensus in here, that is great. If not, my suggestion would be to refer them to the working group, because there's a similar issue already there, and the general question of what to do about this long-standing regulation is something that is on the table in the working group.
