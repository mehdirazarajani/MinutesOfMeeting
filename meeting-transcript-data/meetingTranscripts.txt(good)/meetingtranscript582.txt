                         P R O C E E D I N G

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Good morning, everyone. Welcome to

this, our 582nd meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory

Committee.   My name is Sheldon Friedman, Chair of the Committee,

and as usual, why don't we go around the room and introduce

ourselves?

         Mark, we'll start with you today.

         MR. ALLEN:     Mark Allen with OPM.

         MR. SHULMAN:    Seth Shulman, Department of Defense.

         MS. SOKOL:     Pamela Sokol, Department of the Army.

         MS. SUSZCZYK:    Sarah Suszczyk, National Association of

Government Employees.

         MS. SIMON:     Jacque Simon, AFGE.

         MR. FENAUGHTY:     Bill Fenaughty, MTD and NFFE.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Thank you.

         And if the folks on the sides could also introduce

themselves, please.

         MS. GONZALEZ:     Madeline Gonzalez with OPM.

         MR. MIKOWICZ:     Jerry Mikowicz, OPM, Designated Federal

Officer for this meeting.

         MS. FREEMAN:     I am Darlene Freeman, Department of

Navy.
                                                                    5


         MS. WIGGINS:     Bernadette Wiggins, Army Corps of

Engineers.

         MR. KIDBY:      Mike Kidby, Army Corps of Engineers.

         MR. BRADY:    Jim Brady, DoD.

         MR. FENDT:    Karl Fendt, DoD.

         MR. ROVAN:     Hank Rovan, DoD.

         MR. EICHER:     Mike Eicher, OPM.

         MS. O'KEEFE:     Lindsay O'Keefe, OPM.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Okay, thank you.

         Terri, are we waiting for somebody on the phone?

         MS. WALLACE:     Yes, we are waiting for Ms. Crowe, but

she has not yet joined the call to connect to the meeting.

         MS. GONZALEZ:     Dana Crowe is the representative from

the Air Force

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      We'll get started then.   If the

Air Force can eventually participate by phone, we will connect

them into the meeting.

         So one quick announcement – as you know, we have a

work group meeting scheduled for today, which will take place 10

minutes after the end of this meeting.

         Have people had a chance to review the minutes of our

December meeting, the 581st meeting?
                                                                          6


           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Are there any further corrections?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Any objection to adopting that

transcript?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Hearing no objection, it is

adopted.   Thank you.

           That brings up old business, most of which we have

pending in our work group.      Item (c), Special Wage Schedule Pay

Practice for FWS Lock and Dam Employees,

562-MGT-1, is something we are going to be discussing in the

work group today, and as time permits after that, item (g),

Proposal for FPRAC Review of the FWS Appropriated Fund and

Nonappropriated Fund Operating Manuals, 575-AFGE-1.      In regard

to item (k), Definition of Vanderburgh County, Indiana, to a

Nonappropriated Fund FWS Wage Area,

580-MGT-2, we have a new alternate analysis for this item listed

under new business item (a) Alternate Analysis of Vanderburgh

County, Indiana, 582-MGT-1.      So unless someone wants to bring up

other old business, we'll move on to the new business items.         Is

there any other old business item that people want to bring up
                                                                      7


now?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   So that brings up the first item

under new business:   the Alternative Analysis of Vanderburgh

County, Indiana, 582-MGT-1.

         Mark, can you give us a summary of that, please?

         MR. ALLEN:   Yes, Mr. Chairman.     After our last meeting

in December, the Management members, under

582-MGT-1, took another look at the duty station for the

employees in Vanderburgh County, Indiana.    There are two non-

appropriated fund Federal Wage System employees there working at

the Evansville VA Outpatient Clinic.   We found out that the

Evansville VA Outpatient Clinic is actually a satellite activity

of the Marion VA Medical Center in Williamson County, Illinois.

Williamson County is an area of application county in the St.

Clair, Illinois, NAF wage area.

         So what we are recommending through this alternative

analysis is that Vanderburgh County become part of the St. Clair

wage area, so that the employees at the Evansville VA Outpatient

Clinic are in the same wage area as the parent activity, the

Marion VA Medical Center.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Thank you.    Any questions or
                                                                        8


discussion?

           MS. SIMON:   Could you remind us of what the original

analysis suggested?

           MR. ALLEN:   Under the original analysis, we

recommended defining Vanderburgh County based on the standard

regulatory criteria analysis - without looking in detail at

other activities nearby.       Vanderburgh County was recommended to

be defined to the Christian, KY-Montgomery, TN, wage area based

on distance.

           There was some discussion at the last meeting about

whether distance should prevail in this case or some other

organizational relationship.

           MS. SIMON:   And so you are changing your

recommendation from --

           MR. ALLEN:   Yes.    Vanderburgh County is not to be

defined to the Christian-Montgomery, Tennessee, wage area

anymore.   It is to be defined to the St. Clair, Illinois, wage

area.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Would the Labor members like to

caucus?

           MS. SIMON:   Yes.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Okay.   The Small Pendleton Room is
                                                                      9


available for caucuses.

         [Labor Members went to caucus off the record.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   We are back in session.

         The Labor folks have returned from their caucus, and

we are looking at 582-MGT-1.   Any discussion or --

         MS. SIMON:   No, we're ready to vote.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.

         MS. SIMON:   In favor.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    In favor, okay.   Then there is

consensus to adopt 582-MGT-1, and so we have done so.    Okay,

very good.   Thank you.

         That brings up item (b) under New Business, which is

the Draft, FPRAC Annual Summary for 2012, 582-OC-1.     Have people

had a chance to take a look at that?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Anything that people would like to

see changed?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    If people are comfortable adopting

it, I would like to ask if there is a motion to do so.

         MS. SIMON:   I'd like to make a motion to adopt.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Second?
                                                                        10


         MR. ALLEN:    I'll second.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Okay.   Any opposition to adopting

our report?    Did you want to discuss it, Seth?     You look like

you wanted to say something.

         MR. SHULMAN:    We have to rule by consensus.       We can't

vote because we don't have a quorum.       That's my only

observation.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Oh.   Well, is there consensus to

adopt this report?

         MS. SIMON:     A sense of the FPRAC.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       A sense of the FPRAC, if that's

not an oxymoron.    Never mind.    Let's not go there.

         [Laughter.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Okay.   Well, thank you.

         Is there any other new business that you want to bring

up?

         MS. SIMON:    Just an inquiry that has arisen and I'm

not sure even where it's addressed.       I couldn't find it in the

Appropriated Fund Operating Manual.       One of our locals inquired

about criteria for classification of wage grade jobs, whether

somebody has to spend time actually performing a task that their

classification requires them to be certified in or is having the
                                                                   11


worker possess the certification in a certain skill adequate to

keep the grade classification.

          It has to do with a particular case.    It has to do

with someone who is required in his job to have a certain kind

of license to drive a very large truck, and now they are trying

to downgrade him, saying that he doesn't utilize that skill

frequently enough in the course of his duties, even though they

may call on him from time to time, if it doesn't rise to a level

of 25 percent of his working time, and he no longer should be in

a classification that requires that license, even though

sometimes they will ask him to do work that requires the

license, but it is not 25 percent, and they came to me to ask

whether that was legitimate.     Do you know the answer?

          MR. ALLEN:   I don't know the definite answer to that

myself.   It is an inquiry best directed to our classification

folks at OPM.

          There may be written guidance on that available

currently.   So we will take a look into that.   I don't know if

this is really an FPRAC agenda item or whether I could just get

back to you in person on that.

          MS. SIMON:   Yes.    Well, I think some classification

issues are going to be arising for FPRAC.     The Department of
                                                                    12


Veterans Affairs has been working with OPM to downgrade about

15,000 VA employees, several thousand of whom are wage grade,

and we are going to want some clarification on those positions

as well.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   15,000?

           MS. SIMON:   They are not solely 15,000 wage grade

employees.   Out of the 15,000 employees, some of them are

General Schedule, some of them are Wage Grade.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Is there anything in the Operating

Manual on the issue that Jacque is raising?

           MR. ALLEN:   No.   This committee deals primarily with

pay.   We have documented in the Operating Manual the key ranking

jobs and survey job descriptions, but that's about as far as we

go towards getting involved with how jobs are classified or

positions are classified under the Federal Wage System.     We have

a separate office in OPM that deals with the classification of

positions, and another office in OPM deals with job rating

appeals, if an employee feels his position is inappropriately

graded.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Okay.   Well, anything else on this

topic for the moment?

           MS. SIMON:   No.
                                                               13


           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Any other new business?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Any objection to adjourning?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Hearing no objection, we are

adjourned, and we will have our work group meeting in 10

minutes.   Thank you very much, everyone.
