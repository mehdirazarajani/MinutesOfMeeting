                          P R O C E E D I N G

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Good morning, everyone.     Welcome.

My name is Sheldon Friedman, Chairman of the Federal Prevailing

Rate Advisory Committee, and we are about to start our 577th

meeting as a committee.

          As usual, why don't we go around the table and

introduce ourselves.    Mark, why don't we start with you today.

          MR. ALLEN:    Mark Allen with OPM.

          MS. VANKEUREN:    Tammy Vankeuren with Air Force.

          MR. SAAVEDRA:    Carlos Saavedra, Department of the

Navy.

          MR. CHASE:    Michael Chase, Veterans Affairs.

          MR. BERNHARDT:    Charlie Bernhardt, American Federation

of Government Employees.

          MR. FISHER:     Steve Fisher, ACT.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    And we have Gina on the phone.

Gina, do you hear me?

          MS. LIGHTFOOT-WALKER:    I can.   Good morning.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Why don't you introduce yourself,

please.

          MS. LIGHTFOOT-WALKER:    Gina Lightfoot-Walker with

NAGE.
                                                                    5



          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    And would people around the sides

of the room also introduce themselves, please.

          MS. GONZALEZ:    Madeline Gonzalez with OPM.

          MR. MIKOWICZ:    Jerry Mikowicz, Designated Federal

Official for this meeting, OPM.

          MR. BRADY:    Jim Brady, DoD.

          MR. BAUER:    Brian Bauer, DoD.

          MR. FENDT:    Karl Fendt, DoD.

          MR. ROVAN:    Hank Rovan, DoD.

          MR. EICHER:     Mike Eicher, OPM.

          MS. AVONDET:    Terri Avondet, OPM.

          MS. O'KEEFE:    Lindsey O'Keefe, OPM.

          MR. WALLACE:    Chris Wallace, OPM.

          MR. SUMMERS:    Nate Summers, Air Force legislative

Fellow assigned to OPM.

          MR. LANDIS:     Steve Landis, Act.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   Thank you, everyone.

          We will start with a few announcements.    I suspect

everyone has heard by now, but let me add to the list that our

member, J. David Cox, was elected yesterday as National

President of AFGE, and I'm sure we all would like to

congratulate him for that.    There's a brief story about that,
                                                                       6



that we added at the last minute to your packets.

            Carlos, I understand this might be your last FPRAC

meeting.    Maybe toward the end, do you want to say a few

remarks, if you feel like it?

            [Laughter.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Before you head off to your well-

deserved retirement?

            MR. SAAVEDRA:   Wow!    I'm glad I made it to that.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Yeah, it's good to see you.

            Other than that, you have a letter in your packets to

Director Berry from the entire Rhode Island House and Senate

Delegation in support of the FPRAC recommendation to consolidate

FWS wage areas that lie within GS locality pay areas.      That's

577-OC-1.

            In addition, under 577-OC-2, you have Director Berry's

response to the some 400 letters that he received, largely

handwritten letters, from FWS workers at Tobyhanna Army Depot in

Pennsylvania, also in support of that same FPRAC recommendation.

You previously received the CD-ROM containing all those letters.

            Under 577-OC-3, I circulated a link to the Government

Accountability Office's recent report comparing the various

Federal pay comparability studies that are floating around.       I
                                                                     7



thought that might be of interest as background information to

people, even though they don't look specifically at the FWS pay

system.

          And under 577-OC-4, Director Berry received another

letter from a Member of Congress, Representative Hinchey in New

York, also in support of the consolidate wage areas within

locality pay areas recommendation.

          At this point, I would like to ask Jerry if he

wouldn't mind updating the committee on the status of that

issue..

          MR. MIKOWICZ:     Thank you, Mr. Chair.

          If you notice on your handout, 577-OC-2, the letter to

AFGE about the FPRAC recommendation, towards the bottom, the

Director said, "I am now carefully evaluating all the

information provided to me," and then he goes on to say the next

steps, after he is satisfied, will be in the hands of the Office

of Management and Budget.    I note that that letter was signed on

August 14th, and I was hoping today, August 16th, a couple days

later, maybe I would be able to provide an update.    And I'm

sorry that I cannot.   What you have on August 14th is the

latest.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   Well, thank you.
                                                                    8



          Last week Mark Allen brought to my attention that this

appears to be the 150th anniversary of the Federal Prevailing

Rate Pay System, and we hatched a little idea we want to share

with people.    So, Mark, why don't you tell people about that.

          MR. ALLEN:    I believe that Charlie and I had a

discussion about the history of the prevailing rate concept

within the Federal Government quite a number of years ago.    It

may have been around the 140th anniversary of the concept.    I

think it is a concept that has worked very well.   It's stood the

test of time.

          It originated in 1862 in naval shipyards during the

Civil War, but we're not aware that a whole lot of academic

research has been done into how the pay of Federal blue collar

workers has been maintained over the years.

          I came across what looked like the beginnings of a

doctoral dissertation that somebody from Columbia University

worked on, but we had an idea -- Sheldon and I talked about this

-- that it might be a good idea to suggest to somebody in the

academic community that it become a subject for further

investigation.

          The particular doctoral dissertation that I came

across had to do with the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard, which, of
                                                                     9



course, is long gone, as are a lot of the other shipyards.      I

think there's a lot of history behind how labor made those

shipyards work and made other Federal activities work well.

             So I guess we wanted to throw out the idea to get the

Committee's opinion if you think it's a good idea to put a

suggestion out there to have a graduate student who might be

interested in a general area of labor history to write

something.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   We are thinking there are folks

right in town here.    So, for example, at Georgetown University,

there is a very good labor historian that has students who might

be looking for topics, but we don't want to start exploring this

without the Committee's input and concurrence.

             MR. BERNHARDT:   I think it could be a really

interesting study, Mr. Chairman.

             One of the earliest recorded strikes against the

Federal Government took place at one of those shipyards, and a

couple of years after that, the unionized shipyards were getting

a better deal than the nonunionized shipyards.     I think that

could be an interesting subject for study.     I'd like to read it

when it's done.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Any other thoughts on that?
                                                                    10



          MR. FISHER:    Do we have an idea how we publicize or

request interest from people that might want to write it or look

at the issue?

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    I think we'd probably get ideas

about that from some of the professors we'd contact.   I know,

for example, that they have professional organization of labor

historians.   The Labor Historians have their professional

organization with a LISTSERV, and they could put the word out

that way, asking if there is any student who might be interested

in this topic.

          I think once it looks like this might be of interest,

if it does look like it's going to be of interest, we could also

share something in writing with the Committee, and people on the

Committee might have ideas about how to publicize it as well.

          So unless somebody thinks it's a bad idea,     Mark and

I will work on that.

          That brings up the approval of the transcript from our

last meeting.    Are there any other changes or edits beyond those

that people have already sent in to Madeline?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Any objection to adopting the

transcript?
                                                                     11



           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Hearing none, the transcript is

adopted.

           We have a number of Old Business items, most of which

have been moved over into our work group that's going to convene

after the end of this meeting, but if there's any of these old

business items that people want to discuss in here now, we

certainly can do that.    So the floor is open.

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Just leave them in the work group

then?   Okay.

           We have one New Business item, and that's the

definition of the Rochester, Minnesota, Metropolitan Statistical

Area, 577-MGT-1, which people should have received in advance.

           Mark, would you summarize that one for us, please?

           MR. ALLEN:    Sure.   I'll cover this one just very

briefly.   I think it's most likely one we'll have consensus on.

           The Rochester, Minnesota, MSA is currently split

between the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, and Southwestern Wisconsin

wage areas.     Dodge, Olmstead, and Wabasha Counties, MN, comprise

the Rochester, MN MSA.    Dodge and Olmstead Counties are part of

the area of application of the Minneapolis-St. Paul wage area
                                                                     12



and Wabasha County is part of the area of application of the

Southwestern Wisconsin wage area.     We have a map associated with

this package.    There are no employees affected by the

recommendation.    The management members recommend that Wabasha

County be redefined to the Minneapolis-St. Paul wage area based

on an analysis of the regulatory criteria.     Redefining Wabasha

County to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of application would

place the entire Rochester, MN MSA in the Minneapolis-St. Paul

wage area.    There are 33 Federal wage system employees who are

located in Olmsted County, which is already in the Minneapolis-

St. Paul wage area.30 of those employees work at the Bureau of

Prisons with 29 employees being members of AFGE, and 3 employees

work at the Department of the Army, with 2 employees being

members of ACT.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Any questions or discussion?

             Steve Fisher:   I didn't have any issue with it.    I

reviewed it.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Gina, have you looked at that one?

Are you there?

             MS. LIGHTFOOT-WALKER:   Yeah, I'm here, and, no, I

haven't had a chance to really look at it.     So I don't have any

comments.    Sarah didn't leave me with any instructions on this,
                                                                     13



so --

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     We're light on our numbers here

today.

          MS. LIGHTFOOT-WALKER:    Sorry?

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     We're a little bit short on

numbers of members here today.    I don't know.   Maybe we should

just defer this one.

          MR. ALLEN:   I think that's okay.    We don't have --

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I'm going to find out why people -

- why we're a little bit shorthanded.

          All right.   Well, that being the case, unless there's

-- any other New Business?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Well, Carlos, we're going to miss

you.

          MR. SAAVEDRA:   Well, thank you.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I hope you've got some good plans,

and thank you for many years of service.     Feel free to say

anything you want to say at this point.

          MR. SAAVEDRA:   What I've been telling folks for a

while, because I'm really good at doing nothing, I'm going to do

nothing and enjoy it, and then I'll see what I choose to do, but
                                                                     14



thank you.    It's been great, all the folks that I worked with

here at FPRAC through the years, and it's been a privilege

representing the Department of the Navy.

             I began my career with Air Force and worked with folks

at DoD and the Navy.       So I'm a DoD guy, and I'll leave it at

that, but thank you.       Good luck to all of you.   I hope you enjoy

doing nothing as much as I'm going to.

             [Laughter.]

             MR. SAAVEDRA:    At least for a while.

             MR. ALLEN:    Thanks for everything, Carlos.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Jim?

             MR. BRADY:    Yes.   If you don't mind, I'd like to say a

few words for the Department of Defense.

             We regret that the FPRAC member for the Department of

Defense couldn't be here today.       He was called to an urgent

meeting early this morning, but Carlos, we thank you for your

service, your interest, and all of your contributions over the

years.   Your service has been absolutely exemplary, and our

gratitude is immense.      Thank you very much.

             MR. SAAVEDRA:    Thank you.

             MR. BRADY:    And good luck.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    All right.   Well, there are no
                                                                  15



other New Business items, and if there's no objection to

adjourning, we can do that.

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   And hearing no objection, we're

adjourned, and then in 10 minutes, we'll have a work group

meeting.
