                      P R O C E E D I N G S

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Good morning, everyone, and welcome

to this 574th meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory

Committee.    My name is Sheldon Friedman.       I am Chairman of the

Committee.

             As we usually do, why don't we go around the room and

introduce ourselves, starting today with you, Mark.

             MR. ALLEN:    Mark Allen with OPM.

            MR. SHULMAN:     Seth Shulman, Department of Defense.

            MS. VANKEUREN:     Tammy Vankeuren, Air Force.

            MR. SAAVEDRA:     Carlos Saavedra, Department of the Navy.

            MS. SUSZCZYK:     Sarah Suszczyk, NAGE.

            MR. LANDIS:     Steve Landis, ACT.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I know we are supposed to have

Terry Garnett on the phone.       Terry is recuperating from surgery,

but I guess he hasn't called in yet.

            Folks around the side of the room--

            MR. MIKOWICZ:    Jerry Mikowicz, the Designated Federal

Official.

            MS. GONZALEZ:    Madeline Gonzalez with OPM.

            MS. AVONDET:    Terri Avondet, OPM.
                                                                4


           MS. FREEMAN:     Darlene Freeman, Air Force.

           MR. FENDT:     Karl Fendt, DoD.

           MR. BRADY:     Jim Brady, DoD.

           MS. POWELL:    Dawna Powell, DoD.

           MS. SHAFFER:    Amanda Shaffer, DoD.

           MS. GRAY:    Febbie Gray, OPM.

           MR. WALLACE:    Chris Wallace, OPM.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   Thank you all.

           Starting with our announcements, you have in your

packets the letter that was read into the meeting record last

meeting from Representative Runyan to Director Berry regarding

the AFGE proposal, 574-OC-1, the letter from the labor members of

FPRAC that was also read into the record at the last meeting, and

a letter that Director Berry received from John Gage, President

of AFGE, and I believe everyone has the extensive report from our

working group.   Thanks again to Madeline for all the incredible

hard work and also the folks at DoD who contributed so much to

it.   Any questions about the working group’s report, including

the memo sent with the report to Director Berry, as well as the

minority report from Management?

           We have a few Committee members joining us.    Would you
                                                                  5


identify yourselves for the recorder?

          MS. SIMON:    Jacque Simon, AFGE.

          MS. HANNON:     Ann Marie Hannon for Mr. Chase from VA.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Okay.   Thank you very much.

          So any questions about any of that?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, we can move on to reviewing

the transcripts of our March 8th and March 15th meetings.       Have

people had a chance to review those?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Are there any -- I guess we'll take

them one at a time starting with March 8th.     Any further

corrections to the March 8th transcript?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, any objections to adopting

it?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Hearing none, it's adopted.

          And now the March 15th meeting transcript.     Any further

changes or corrections?

          [No audible response.]
                                                                  6


          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Are there any objections to

adopting it?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Hearing no objections, that's

adopted too.     All right.   We have adopted the transcripts of our

last meetings.

          We have a series of Old Business items that we will be

returning our attention to.      Is there anyone who wants to bring

up anything about any of them this morning?

          MS. SIMON:     What's the current status of the issue with

the Federal Wage System Lock and Dam employees in Mississippi?

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Well, basically, we have it as an

Old Business item.     This is actually a different issue than that.

This is Arkansas, but they are somewhat related.

          MS. SIMON:     Okay.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      I think we do have to revisit it,

but --

          MS. SIMON:    Okay.

          MR. ALLEN:    I think, Mr. Chairman, we had deferred

these issues to another working group that we put on hold last

August while we were examining the wage area definition study.
                                                                 7


          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Right.

          MR. ALLEN:     I think it's probably a good idea for the

members to take another look at the documents that are related to

that other working group, and I think we should think about

establishing a meeting date for the next working group meeting.

We have had a policy of meeting after an FPRAC meeting.     The next

one would be about a month from now, May 24th.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Yeah, that seems like a reasonable

idea to me.

          Other thoughts on that, that people want to express

now?

          MS. SIMON:     I know I will be out of town on May 24th.

          MR. SHULMAN:    Particularly since the lock and dam

questions and issues are primarily Department of the Army, we

would want to have Department of the Army present for that

discussion, I would think.     That would seem correct, right?

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Well, maybe we will wait until the

June meeting, so we can arrange both of those, your

participation, Jacque, as well as --

          MS. SIMON:   Okay.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      -- the appropriate person from the
                                                                   8


Department of the Army.

           MR. ALLEN:     In the meantime, if anybody has any

questions that we could help out on, or if you would like us to

provide any background information in addition to what we have

already presented in the documents that are under old business,

we would be more than happy to do that.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I think we should prime the pump

electronically with some background information.     We will work on

that.

           Any other comments on the Old Business items at this

point?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, we have two new business

items.

           The first is our Annual Summary.    You have in your

packages, and received electronically ahead of time, the Annual

Summary for 2011 for FPRAC.     Is there any objection to us

adopting it?   Any discussion of it, to start with, I guess?      Have

people had a chance to review it?     I'm going in reverse order

today.   Question one, have you had a chance to review it?

           MR. SHULMAN:    Not in its entirety.
                                                                   9


             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Is there any question or discussion

about it?

             MS. SUSZCZYK:   I have not had an opportunity to review

it in its entirety, either.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Well --

             MR. ALLEN:   I would just make an observation, Mr.

Chairman.    The Committee has covered a lot of ground in the last

year, which is what we documented in this report.     I think it

would bear everybody taking a close look at it.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   We don't have a very crowded

agenda.     I wonder if it would make sense to take a short recess

and give people a chance to read it, and then we can possibly

dispose of this today.

             MS. SUSZCZYK:   Sounds like a plan.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Shall we take 10, 15 minutes?    How

much time would people want?

            MR. ALLEN:    I've already reviewed it myself.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    I know.

            [Laughter.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Me, too.

            MS. SIMON:    Ten.
                                                                    10


           MS. SUSZCZYK:     Ten.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Okay.   So we are going to take a

10-minute recess.

           [Recess taken.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       We are back in session.   Has

everybody has a chance to review the draft Calendar Year 2011

Annual Summary of FPRAC?

           MR. SHULMAN:    Yes.

           MS. SIMON:   Yes.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Any changes that people feel are

needed?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Any objection to adopting it?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Hearing none, it is adopted.    Thank

you all.

           That brings up Item B under New Business, Abolishment

of the Washington D.C. Special Wage Schedule for Printing and

Lithographic Positions, 574-MGT-1.

           Mark, would you summarize that, please?

           MR. ALLEN:   Yes.    Under 574-MGT-1, the Management
                                                                 11


members of FPRAC are recommending that the last remaining

printing and lithographic special schedule be abolished.    As most

of us are aware, the printing industry within the Federal

Government has changed over the years since the special schedules

were established, and printing in the private sector has also

changed dramatically.

          We have far fewer employees who are paid from the

special wage schedule now than we used to have.   There is a

provision that FPRAC worked out back in the mid 1970s that left

the printing and lithographic special schedules as three step-

rate schedules but required that no rate, no Step 3 rate, under a

printing and lithographic schedule be lower than the regular

schedule's Step 5 rate.   That is the case for almost all of the

grade levels with the Washington, D.C., printing and lithographic

wage schedule.

          Since there is no benefit to any of the remaining 24

employees who are currently covered by the printing and

lithographic wage schedule, we are recommending that we just get

rid of the wage schedule entirely and pay the employees from the

regular wage schedule.    This will eliminate the need to do a

full-scale wage survey just to cover those 24 employees with the
                                                                 12


end result being that they are going to be paid rates equivalent

to what's on the regular schedule anyway.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Any questions or discussion?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Is there consensus to do this?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    It is adopted, 574-MGT-1.

          Is there any other New Business?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    If not, absent some objection, we

could adjourn.

          MR. LANDIS:   I'm sorry.   This is my first time, so I am

not familiar with how everything is run.

          I guess I missed my opportunity.      I just wanted to ask

a question.   It would have been under Old Business, though.     I

guess it's too late for that.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    No, go ahead.

          MR. LANDIS:   Okay.   I have read through the report that

is here, and I have a specific question about the Joint Base

McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst wage area, and I understand that this

report is created to cover that amongst many other things.
                                                                13


           My question would be directed to OPM as to how the

McGuire-Fort Dix-Lakehurst Joint Base was created October 1st of

2009.   We had all type of documentation from the local

congressman at the time and from OPM as well that it was all

supposed to be moved to the New York pay scale at that time,

2-1/2 years ago.   It wasn't.

           We directed our questions at the time and received no

information for a while.   We found out that it could have been

the possibility that -- I believe there is a person appointed as

the Director of the wage scale system that wasn't appointed at

the time, and so it got overlooked.   But then when that was

brought to their attention, nothing ever happened.   It's been

2-1/2 years now.

           I know this is just one tiny, specific thing, but

there's about 550 employees there that were promised a wage area

upgrade in 2009, watched the rest of the members, the GS people

and the base, get this wage area upgrade.   Sometimes you have a

GS and a WG working in the same building that are in different

wage areas, and I am just wondering how this has gotten

overlooked for 2-1/2 years and why nothing has been done about

it.
                                                                   14


            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I think it's a good question.

            You are correct that this recommendation that we did

vote on at our last meeting would address it, and it's now before

Director Berry.

            MR. LANDIS:    Okay.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     We have actually had a lot of input

from folks, including the prior commander of the base who

attended one of our meetings in 2010.

            MR. LANDIS:    Yeah, General -- or Colonel Grosso,

General Grosso now.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Yeah.   So we, as you say, have had

a lot of input also from Members of Congress; in fact, I think a

letter from the entire New Jersey delegation of Senators and

Representatives.    So we've certainly heard a lot about the issue.

            The question of why it has been taking us so long to

deal with, I really can't give you a good answer to that one,

frankly.    I don't know if anyone else wants to.

            MR. ALLEN:    I think it is actually a fairly simple

reason.    It is not something that has been overlooked.     We have

had testimony at this Committee for at least the last couple

years concerning the Joint Base.
                                                                 15


          The only proposal that we have had on the agenda for

the Committee to discuss that would have affected the Joint Base

is the recommendation or proposal that is addressed in this

working group report that went forward to the Director of OPM.

          It's taken the Committee quite a long time without

reaching consensus to present this report to the Director.

          So I think what you really need to understand is that

the Joint Base issue was wrapped up in an overall discussion of

whether or not to use GS locality pay areas to define Federal

Wage System wage areas.    The Committee has not considered the

Joint Base on its own merits.    So we are in the position now

where we are waiting for the Director of OPM to make a decision

on whether or not to proceed with the FPRAC recommendation that

has been presented to him.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     So, anyway, thanks for coming

today.

          MR. LANDIS:     Thank you.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     We didn't want you to come all this

way and not get your question answered.

          Any other questions, business?

          [No audible response.]
                                                              16


          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, if there's no objection,

how about we adjourn?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Okay, we are adjourned.   See you

next time, everyone.
