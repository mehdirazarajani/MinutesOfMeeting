                    P R O C E E D I N G S

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Good morning, everyone, and welcome

to this 568th meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory

Committee, and as we usually do, why don't we start with

introductions.

          My name is Sheldon Friedman.    I am the Chairman of

FPRAC.

          MR. FENAUGHTY:    Bill Fenaughty.    I'm with Metal Trades

through NFFE.

          MR. FISHER:    Steve Fisher, ACT.

          MS. SUSZCZYK:    Sarah Suszczyk, NAGE.

          MR. ALLEN:    Mark Allen with OPM.

          MR. HUNTER:    Thurstan Hunter with the Department of

Veterans Affairs.

          MR. MIKOWICZ:    Jerry Mikowicz, OPM, the Designated

Federal Official.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    And I think we have one member

participating by phone.

          MS. SIMON:    Jackie Simon, AFGE.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   And why don't we also have

folks who are visiting or guests who are around the side of the
                                                                     4


room introduce themselves.

            MS. GONZALEZ:    Madeline Gonzalez with OPM.

            MS. AVONDET:    Terri Avondet, OPM.

            MS. WILSON:    Temple Wilson, OPM.

            MR. BRADY:    Jim Brady, DoD.

            MR. FENDT:    Karl Fendt, DoD.

            MS. VANKEUREN:    Tammy Vankeuren, Air Force.

            MS. CHAVES:    Becky Chaves, DoD.

            MR. ROVAN:    Hank Rovan, DoD.

            MS. GRAY:    Febbie Gray, OPM.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   So, good morning again.

            We have one item of announcement, the Fiscal Year 2012

Prevailing Rate Pay Adjustments memorandum that is in your

packets, essentially detailing how the pay freeze impacts FWS

folks.    Any questions or discussion about that?

            MR. ALLEN:    If there are no questions, I will give a

very brief summary of what this is and what it does for the

record.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.

            MR. ALLEN:    As everybody knows, the Federal Wage System

is under a pay freeze between January 2011 and December 2012.
                                                                      5


This memorandum provides OPM guidance to lead agencies under the

Federal Wage System.    It states that pay adjustments are still

frozen during fiscal year 2012 and provides instructions on how

agencies should implement the pay freeze during FY 2012. It also

explains the requirement under the Prevailing Rate Systems Act

for Federal Wage System wage schedules to continue to be released

on their normal effective dates and that’s the main reason for

getting this memorandum out.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Thank you, Mark.

          Unless there's anything else on this item, our next

agenda item is review and hopefully adoption of the transcript of

our previous meeting.    Has everyone had a chance to review the

transcript from the last meeting?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Are there any other corrections or

changes beyond those that people have already submitted to us?

          MS. SUSZCZYK:    No.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, then is there a motion to

adopt the transcript from the last meeting?

          MR. FISHER:    I'll make the motion.

          MR. ALLEN:    And I'll second.
                                                                     6


           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   And is there any objection to

adopting the transcript?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Hearing no objection, it is

adopted.

           Moving on to a list of old business items, most of

these are in abeyance pending working group consideration.      Is

there anything new today on Item (e)?     Any discussion of that,

the abolishment of Montgomery, Pennsylvania, Nonappropriated Fund

Wage Area?

           MR. ALLEN:   Mr. Chairman, the Management members are

still investigating the background of how Nonappropriated Fund

Wage Areas have been established and changed in the past, so

there is nothing new on that yet.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Okay.    Any questions from the Labor

side on that one today?

           MR. FENAUGHTY:   I'm sorry.   I didn't hear what Mark

said.

           MR. ALLEN:   A couple of meetings ago, we said that we

would look into the background of how decisions had previously

been made for redefining Nonappropriated Fund Wage Areas, and the
                                                                    7


Management members are still looking into that.

          MR. FENAUGHTY:   Okay.

          MR. ALLEN:   It's a pretty lengthy background to go

through and figure how things were decided.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Okay.   We will revisit that when

you have some information for us.

          Which brings up new business, which consists today of a

memorandum from Commander David Hanson, Department of the Air

Force, which I believe everyone has.    Any questions about that,

or discussion?

          It bears on the item that we are working on in our

working group.   Sarah, did you want to say anything about it?

          MS. SUSZCZYK:    I know that Commander Hanson submitted

it to FPRAC in August, and NAGE wanted to ensure that it was on

the record.   I understand that we are still working on this issue

in the working group, but we wanted to make sure that Commander

Hanson's position was in the record.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Thank you.   Well, we welcome his

input, and it is very helpful to have it.

          Regarding future meeting dates, I believe everyone got

an e-mail from Madeline regarding our 2012 proposed meeting
                                                                    8


dates. If you haven't done so already, please respond to her

about whether those work for you.

          Madeline, have you heard back from anybody about that?

 That means they like all those dates, right?

          MS. GONZALEZ:    Exactly.   If I don't hear back by the

end of the month, I assume that you're fine.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   So --

          MR. ALLEN:    Madeline has heard from me.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Oh, I see.

          MR. FISHER:    I just recorded them.   I thought it was

mandatory.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   So we will assume that

everybody likes those dates if we don't hear from you quickly to

the contrary.

          Well, are there any other new business items that

people want to bring up?    I thought we set a record last month

for quickest FPRAC meeting ever, but we might have actually

beaten it today.   I don't know.

          We will be convening in 10 minutes or so as a working

group on the important issue before us.

          Well, does anybody want to make a motion to adjourn?
                                                                    9


          MR. FISHER:    I will make a motion.

          MR. ALLEN:    Second.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Okay.

          MR. FENAUGHTY:    We are under 6 minutes.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Wow!

          MR. FENAUGHTY:    That's pretty good.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Okay.   So I guess there's no

objection to adjourning.

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Hearing none, we'll adjourn, and we

will convene in the Small Pendleton Room for those of us who are

in the working group.

                             •-•-•
