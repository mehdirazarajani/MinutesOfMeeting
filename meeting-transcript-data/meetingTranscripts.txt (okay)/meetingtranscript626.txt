CHAIR NELSON: Good morning, everyone. This meeting will come to order. 

This is the 626th meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee. It's 

now 10:03. We're doing well. 

The meeting is being recorded on improvised recorders, and a transcript will be 

provided to the members, off the improvised recorders. 

My name is Jill Nelson, Chair of this Committee. We'll start with introductions. 

We'll start with Union first. 

MR. KIELTY: My name is Travis Kielty, with the Association of Civilian 

Technicians.  

MR. LOEB: Richard Loeb, policy counsel with AFGE. 

CHAIR NELSON: We'll now go to the Management Side. 

MR. ALLEN: Mark Allen with OPM. 

MR. LYNCH: Christopher Lynch, Department of Defense. 

MS. REYNOLDS: Virginia Reynolds, Air Force. 

MR. BUCK: Gary Buck, Department of Army. 

MS. HANNAH: Karen Hannah, VA. 

CHAIR NELSON: And we have several people on the phone. Could you go 

ahead and introduce yourselves? 

MS. BRADY: Leah Brady with VA. 

MR. SHORE: Rob Shore with NAGE. 

CHAIR NELSON: I guess we only have two at the moment. 

Let's go ahead and go down around the side.

MS. ROBERTS: Brenda Roberts, OPM, Designated Federal Officer. 

MS. DAVIDQUINTERO: Leticia DavidQuintero, Department of the Navy. 

MS. WILLIS: Sheila Willis, VA. 

MR. BAUER: Brian Bauer, DoD. 

MR. EICHER: Mike Eicher, OPM. 

MS. PAUNOIU: Ana Paunoiu, OPM. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Madeline Gonzalez, OPM. 

CHAIR NELSON: Thank you. If we hear someone else come on, we'll have to 

jump at that one. 

Announcements. The only announcement I have is like I'm glad most of you have 

jackets. 

[Laughter.] 

CHAIR NELSON: It's a little nippy, and Mike has even got his snowman tie on in 

honor of the fact that it's cold in this room, but what can I say? 

MR. EICHER: Well, after being outside, this feels great. 

CHAIR NELSON: It feels good. Okay. 

MR. EICHER: It feels wonderful. 

CHAIR NELSON: I have no formal announcements. Does anyone have an 

announcement to make today? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIR NELSON: No? Okay. 

Let's review the minutes of the 625th meeting held on June 20th. OPM received 

no edits on this transcript. Are there any edits offered today? 

[No audible response.]

CHAIR NELSON: It doesn't look like it. So seeing and hearing none, the Chair 

will entertain a motion to accept the minutes of the 625th meeting. 

MR. ALLEN: Move to accept. 

MR. LOEB: Second. 

CHAIR NELSON: Moved and seconded. So we have accepted the minutes. 

We are going to move on to Old Business, and I have a feeling we're going to 

jump around probably a little bit. But let's start with the NAGE, the March 9, 2016, request to 

reexamine the placement of Wage Grade employees working in Shawnee County. 

I know Rob has been asking for a vote on this; however, this agenda item is still 

tied up with the broader recommendation, where a new cost analysis study has been requested. 

Mark, do you have anything to say on that? 

MR. ALLEN: No. I haven't heard from Jacque who had entertained the idea of 

asking for additional information beyond the costing we did a few months ago. 

CHAIR NELSON: She was asked to submit that in writing to you. You haven't 

received that yet? 

MR. ALLEN: No, I haven't seen it yet. 

CHAIR NELSON: Okay. So, Rob, I'm assuming we're deferring this item again. I 

don't think we have enough members here to vote. 

MR. SHORE: Yeah. I mean, I would request the same thing, but I think you beat 

me to the punch. 

CHAIR NELSON: Okay. Let's go ahead and do that, and to be honest with you, I 

don't think we have a quorum for a vote anyhow. 

 

7 

MR. ALLEN: I was going to do a parliamentary inquiry, but thank you, Chair 

Nelson, for recognizing that. 

CHAIR NELSON: Yeah. So there won't be votes done today. 

The definition of Pitt County, we have been deferring that because Jacque has 

wanted President Cox here to address this issue, and he is not present in the room and not called 

in, so— 

MR. ALLEN: I feel him in spirit. 

[Laughter.] 

CHAIR NELSON: Okay, J. David. 

MR. LOEB: Not as much as I do. 

[Laughter.] 

CHAIR NELSON: So I'm assuming we're deferring this one again. 

MR. LOEB: AFGE would respectfully request that it be deferred. 

CHAIR NELSON: Okay. Now we're on to letter (c), which brings this whole 

issue right back up in front again. That is the request to review a proposal to not allow the 

Federal Wage System boundaries to split the General Schedule locality pay areas. 

At last month's meeting, AFGE requested a new cost estimate for this proposal. 

Jacque agreed to put the request in writing. Mark has just told us all that he hasn't received 

Jacque's written request. So I'm assuming we're deferring this one too? 

MR. LOEB: It would appear that way. I will bring all this back to Jacque, with 

whom hopefully I'll be speaking momentarily after this meeting or certainly sometime today. 

CHAIR NELSON: Please. Because, I mean, we can't move forward with— 

MR. LOEB: I understand completely. Nobody knows how to nag her better than 

 

8 

me. 

CHAIR NELSON: Well, thank you. You've just been assigned a nagging detail. 

MR. LOEB: That's my full-time job. 

CHAIR NELSON: On the definition of Columbia , Missouri, Metropolitan 

Statistical Area, at the last meeting, Mark discussed the item and stated that Management's 

recommendation is to keep the metropolitan area whole, as stated in the regulations, and that the 

best solution is to have Cooper and Howard Counties both added to the St. Louis wage area. 

Jacque moved the counties be added to Kansas City. 

There was no consensus. 

Union asked for this item and asked Management to give it a little more thought 

in consideration for the possibility of Kansas City. 

Mark, do you have any update on this? 

MR. ALLEN: I would say if we're going by the letter of the regulations, the 

Management proposal would be the one that should be followed by OPM. 

But having said that, there is prior history to this issue, and back in—I believe it 

was 2008 —there was a review of the Columbia, MO MSA, which  was tabled after there was no 

consensus on the issue. Basically, we knew at that time there was a split in the metropolitan area, 

and the Management members agreed with the Labor members to go ahead and just not make 

any changes. 

I think we have to have a really clear-cut reason to change the St. Louis wage 

area, and frankly, I'm not seeing a good reason to move Boone County into the Kansas City wage 

area. 

Jacque at the last meeting had said it was a toss-up. I don't really see this one as 

 

9 

being a toss-up necessarily, but I would say that we do need a good reason to move a substantial 

number of employees into a different wage area. 

So one option is to just table this one and leave the two fairly rural counties in the 

Kansas City wage area. 

We have followed this course of action in a couple of other cases, where we have 

a wage area that has a metropolitan area on the very outskirts of the wage area, and it's split 

between a city with one or two counties that are fairly rural. But because of quirks in 

metropolitan area definitions and how they're done, those counties are added into the 

metropolitan area. But I don't think anybody would really think that they are metropolitan, but 

that's not really how the metropolitan area definitions work. They do add some rural areas to the 

metropolitan areas. 

But that was not the original way the statutory intent or the regulatory intent was 

back when the pay system was established because the metropolitan areas were much smaller 

than they are these days. 

CHAIR NELSON: So you would like to table this one or defer it until another 

meeting? 

MR. ALLEN: I am interested in discussion with many of the members about that. 

MR. BUCK: I'm fine with it. 

MR. LYNCH: I have no objection. 

MR. LOEB: I think AFGE would like to ask that those be deferred. 

CHAIR NELSON: Deferred? Okay. 

Are you okay with that? 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. 

 

10 

CHAIR NELSON: Okay. Moving on to the New Business. We gave the 

Definition of the Fort Smith Metropolitan Statistical Area, and that's in your folders. It is 626-

MGT-1. 

years. 

Mark, do you want to brief us on this agenda item? 

MR. ALLEN: Sure. This was also one that has been on the agenda in previous 

In this case, we don't think it's a good idea to split Fort Smith in between two 

wage areas. So what we are recommending is that Crawford, Sebastian, and Sequoyah Counties 

continue to be defined to the Tulsa, Oklahoma, wage area. 

Several years ago, there was a change that moved some of these counties from the 

Little Rock, Arkansas, wage area to the Tulsa wage area. 

Franklin County should continue to be defined to the Little Rock wage area, but 

part of it includes Fort Chaffee, which has a tiny part of it located in Franklin County. There are 

now a few employees there. 

Given the standard operating rules of the Federal Wage System, we don't think it's 

a good idea to have a single installation split between two wage areas, so we recommend moving 

that part of Franklin County into the Tulsa wage area. The rest of Franklin County should, 

however, stay in the Little Rock wage area so as not to split the Ozark National Forward between 

wage areas. 

9? 

CHAIR NELSON: Any discussion on this? 

MR. LOEB: My only question for Mark is, this is three employees at Wage Grade 

MR. ALLEN: That is correct, yes. 

 

11 

MR. LOEB: That's it. I mean, I will have to go back because this is the first time 

we've seen it, and also because this does seem to involve splitting a county, as I understand it. 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. 

MR. LOEB: Okay. I will ask and bring this back. I don't see any real issue with 

the three Wage Grade 9's. 

CHAIR NELSON: Actually, from what I was looking at, after they get past Step 

2, there is a definite increase. 

MR. LOEB: Right. It is an interesting wage table, but I want to run it by— 

CHAIR NELSON: Stop a second. 

It sounds like we've had somebody else come on. Has somebody else come on to 

the meeting? 

MR. EICHER: Can I ask who just joined the phone call? 

MS. SIMON: Yes. This is Jacque Simon. 

CHAIR NELSON: Thanks, Jacque. 

Okay. I didn't mean to cut you off, Richard. 

MR. LOEB: Hi, Jacque. We are discussing the new case that splits one of the 

counties, and the Chair was pointing out that the three affected employees who are Wage Grade 

9 would actually be moved to the Tulsa, Oklahoma, wage area, which— 

MS. SIMON: I'm sorry. I don't know if you can hear me, but I can't hear you. 

MR. LOEB: Okay. 

MR. ALLEN: That is because the phone is all the way over there. 

MR. LOEB: That could be one reason. 

CHAIR NELSON: We are having technology issues today. 

MS. SIMON: I'm sorry. 

 

12 

MR. LOEB: But I understand the impact on those three employees, and it is a 

positive one. But I would want to just check back. The two issues obviously are the lower wage 

grades, although there is nobody at that wage grade. 

Also, the splitting of the county issue, I want to just discuss that maybe when we 

have a—I can actually be heard. 

MR. ALLEN: I will just mention— 

CHAIR NELSON: Speak loud.  

MR. ALLEN: Hi, Jacque. Can you hear me? 

MS. SIMON: Hi. Yes. I mean, I can hear you because you're yelling. That's the 

only reason I can hear you. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. The current definition of the wage area has Franklin County, 

Arkansas, as part of the Little Rock wage area. The decision to split the Fort Smith, Arkansas, 

MSA was made several years ago so that the employees who were closer to Tulsa at Fort 

Chaffee could go into the Tulsa wage area. However, the employees who were working at the 

Ozark National Forest in Franklin County, with Franklin County being closer to Little Rock than 

Tulsa, we did not want at that time to split the employees into two separate wage areas if they're 

working at the Ozark National Forest. 

Since that time, there are now three employees in Franklin County who are in a 

sliver of Fort Chaffee that extends into Franklin County, and the Management members think it's 

not a good idea to have those employees separated from the rest of their coworkers in the 

majority of the installation. It's just a standard operating procedure. 

CHAIR NELSON: Do you have any comments on it, Jacque or Rob? 

 

13 

MS. SIMON: Well, I don't think we're ready to take a vote on it today. I want to 

have a chance to look into it a little more. 

MR. LOEB: Jacque, it's Richard. That's exactly what I said. 

The other thing is I'm not sure we have a— 

CHAIR NELSON: We don't have a quorum. 

MR. LOEB: We don't have a quorum. That is why we are going to discuss it, just 

simply examining it some more, so thank you. 

CHAIR NELSON: Okay. So let's go ahead and defer this item. 

At this point, we've moved through our agenda pretty rapidly, and we have a lot 

on the calendar for August, don't we? 

Future meeting dates are set forth on the agenda.  

Since we have covered everything, is there a motion for adjournment? 

MR. LOEB: Motion to adjourn. 

CHAIR NELSON: Do we have a second? 

MR. ALLEN: And a second. 

CHAIR NELSON: All in favor of adjourning? 

[Chorus of ayes.] 

CHAIR NELSON: Thank you.
