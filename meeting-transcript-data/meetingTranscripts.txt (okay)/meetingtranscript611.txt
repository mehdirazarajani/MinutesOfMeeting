P R O C E E D I N G  

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to this, our 611th 

meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee. Happy St. Patrick’s Day to those of 

you who are celebrating it. 

And as we usually do, why don't we go around the room and introduce ourselves. 

I’m Sheldon Friedman, Chair of the Committee. Mark, why don't we start with you today, 

please? 

MR. ALLEN: Mark Allen with OPM. 

MR. DAVEY: Jim Davey with DoD. 

MR. CURLEY: Dave Curley with Air Force. 

MR. BUCK: Gary Buck, Army. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Arlene, why don't you introduce yourself please? 

MS. ROMBA: [via telephone] Arleen Romba, VA. 

MR. PHELPS: Dennis Phelps, Metal Trades Department. 

MS. ARCHER: Candace Archer, AFGE. 

MS. SIMON: Jacque Simon, AFGE.

MS. PAUNOIU: Ana Paunoiu, OPM. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Madeline Gonzalez with OPM. 

MR. EICHER: Mike Eicher, OPM. 

MR. ELLIOTT: Lamar Elliott, ACT. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Thank you. 

Just a couple of quick announcements. You have in your packets the annual 

summary of our Committee's work for 2015. This is what we approved last month, and what we 

have in the packet is the final. And it should go up on our website before too long, I would hope. 

Also, the new charter for the Committee, this is an every-2-year requirement 

under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, I believe. Just for your information, here is our latest 

charter. 

Any questions about either of those things? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, we could go on to reviewing and hopefully 

approving the transcript of our last meeting. Is there any change beyond those we've heard from 

you about that anybody wants to see made in the transcript of the last meeting? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing no changes, is there any disagreement with 

approving the transcript of the last meeting? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. It appears we have agreement to adopt the 

5 

transcript. Thank you. 

We do have some Old Business items kicking around, but what I would suggest is 

we skip first down to the New Business items of which we have two that I'm aware of, and that 

are on the agenda. If that's okay, why don't we move to those, first one being 611-MGT-1, 

Definitions of Metropolitan Statistical Areas. About four of them have been packaged together. 

Mark, would you please summarize those for us? 

MR. ALLEN: Yes, Mr. Chairman. Happy St. Patrick's Day, everyone. 

Under 611-MGT-1, this is part of an ongoing effort that OPM has under way so 

that Federal Wage System wage areas don't subdivide metropolitan statistical areas, unless 

there's a good reason to do so. 

Under this proposal, we recommend really minor changes in four wage areas. We 

recommend that Union County, Indiana, be redefined from the Dayton, Ohio, area of application 

to the Cincinnati, Ohio, area of application; San Benito County, California, be redefined from the 

Salinas-Monterrey, California, area of application to the San Francisco, California, area of 

application; Windham County, Connecticut, be redefined from the New London, Connecticut, 

area of application to the Central and Western Massachusetts area of application; and Columbia 

County, Washington, be redefined from the Spokane, Washington, area of application to the 

Southeastern Washington/Eastern Oregon area of application. And as the Chairman said, these 

are basically four packages rolled into one, just for the sake of convenience. 

What we've provided here is an analysis of each county and the number of 

employees who would be affected by the change. At least in two of them, there are no employees 

affected. 

There are maps of the wage areas, Dayton and Cincinnati for the first one. There 

6 

are wage schedules. 

The package itself is pretty self-explanatory and follows the same patterns we've 

used before for regulatory criteria analysis indicating which is the most appropriate wage area 

definition for the entire metropolitan statistical area, so that we're no longer splitting wage areas 

with metropolitan areas. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So I think you indicated these were all triggered by 

OMB changes in the definition of MSAs around the country, which were in turn triggered by the 

results of the 2010 Census; is that right? 

MR. ALLEN: That's right, yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any questions or discussion? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there a consensus to adopt. 611-MGT-1? Do you 

folks need a caucus?  

All right. I believe we do have the Small Pendleton Room available for that. 

[Labor members go in caucus off the record.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: We are back in session. Labor has returned from its 

caucus. Is there anything to report? 

MS. SIMON: We're ready to vote. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Well, is there consensus to adopt 611-MGT-1? 

MS. SIMON: Yes. 

MR. PHELPS: Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. We've adopted it. Very good. 

That brings up the next New Business item, a letter from National Association of 

7 

Government Employees, 611-NAGE-1. Rob, would you like to fill us in on this one? 

MR. SHORE: Yeah. So, probably, 2 months ago, 3 months ago, we were 

contacted by some employees at the Topeka, Kansas, AMC, and they raised some concerns 

regarding the placement of Shawnee County in the Topeka wage area versus in the Kansas City 

wage area. The concerns that I think are laid out in the letter talk about wage grade employees in 

the Topeka wage area working interchangeably with wage grade employees in the Kansas City 

wage area. So, at this point, we were asking for a study of the Shawnee County and, I guess, 

Topeka wage area and the possible abolishment of the wage area, depending on the outcome of 

the study. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. OPM staff would be happy to take a look at this one, as we 

have with others, to see what things are going on in those two wage areas—distance, commuting 

patterns, etc. , and get some input from VA. I don't know if we'd have the report ready for the 

next meeting, but hopefully for the following one. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any other discussion of this issue at this time? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Then we will await the OPM staff report. 

We do have three Old Business items. Are there any that we're prepared to deal 

with this morning? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I don't think any of them are urgent, but they have 

been there quite a while. 

MR. ALLEN: At least two, Mr. Chairman, we haven't had consensus on, and I 

would make a suggestion that if we're not going to deal with those by voting, we probably should 

8 

just table those and get them off the agenda. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Which two are those, Mark? 

MR. ALLEN: One would be the review of Lee County, Virginia, 557-MGT-2, 

which was introduced back in 2010; and then the other one is 562-MGT-2, which is the review 

of the South Bend-Mishawaka, Indiana-Michigan MSA. That was introduced in 2011. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And if those are tabled, they could be brought back at 

any time? 

MR. ALLEN: That's correct, yeah. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there a consensus to table those? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. We'll do that, then. 

Any interest in taking up the other one this morning? That is (b), 607-OPM-3. 

MR. ALLEN: I am perfectly fine with this one remaining on the agenda. We 

really haven’t had an in-depth discussion on it. This is an OPM document, so there is no 

Management proposal to do anything with Green County. However, having said that, I don't 

really see a reason under the regulatory criteria for changing the definition of Green County to a 

different wage area. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there any other discussion of that one right now? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: No? All right. 

Are there any other new business items that we haven't already dealt with? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, it would certainly be in order to adjourn. Is 

9 

there any objection to adjourning? 

MS. SIMON: None. 

MR. ALLEN: No. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Wow! That's enthusiasm. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. PHELPS: Wish they were all like that, huh, Sheldon? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. Well, I'll see everybody next month, and 

we are adjourned. Thank you.
