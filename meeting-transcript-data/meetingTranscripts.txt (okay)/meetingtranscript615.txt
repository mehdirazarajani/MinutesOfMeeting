CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this, our 

615th meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee. My name is Sheldon 

Friedman, Chair of the Committee. And, as usual, I’d appreciate it if we could go around the 

room and introduce ourselves. Candace, let’s start with you today. 

MS. ARCHER: Candace Archer, AFGE. 

MR. SHORE: Rob Shore, NAGE. 

MR. LANDIS: Steve Landis, ACT. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Jacque, are you on the phone? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Good timing, Randy. Can you introduce yourself for 

MR. ERWIN: Hi. Randy Erwin with NFFE and representing Metal Trades 

the recorder? 

Department. 

MR. ALLEN: Mark Allen with OPM. 

MR. LYNCH: Christopher Lynch, DoD. 

MR. BUCK: Gary Buck, Army. 

MS. MONTGOMERY: Carmen Montgomery, Veterans Administration. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And I'd appreciate it if the other folks in the room 

would introduce themselves. Jeanne? 

MS. JACOBSON: Jeanne Jacobson, OPM, Designated Federal Officer. 

MR. BRADY: Jim Brady, DoD. 

MR. EICHER: Mike Eicher, OPM. 

 
 

MS. GONZALEZ: Madeline Gonzalez, OPM. 

MR. BELTRAN: Jeff Beltran, ACT. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Good to meet you, Jeffrey. 

4 

Okay. The only announcement I have is that our work group meeting has been 

postponed till next month. I hope this doesn't cause undue heartburn to anybody. Any other 

announcements? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If there are no other announcements, that brings up 

review of the minutes of our last meeting. Does anybody have additional corrections beyond 

those we have heard about from you? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, is there any objection to adopting the transcript 

of our last meeting? 

MR. SHORE: No objection. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing no objection, the transcript is adopted. 

Thank you. 

So that brings up Old Business. We have the issue of Shawnee County, Kansas, 

and the Topeka wage area as our first item. There are lots of different exhibits related to that, 

including a new one, 615-OPM-1, which was prepared in response to some questions that were 

raised at our last meeting. 

Rob, do you want to kick off the discussion, or I could ask Mark to summarize 

615-OPM-1? 

MR. SHORE: I'll just give a quick update. At the last meeting, there were a 

 
 

5 

couple of questions that I was asked to look into, which I have started, but I don't have the 

additional information yet. I know we had talked about getting some more documents. So I'm 

hopeful that before next meeting, I can have everything and submit it to Madeline to have it 

ready, but that's the update I have right now. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Then can we go ahead and get a summary of 615-

OPM-1 from Mark? 

MR. ALLEN: Sure. Under 615-OPM-1, we are asked to provide some additional 

information on the historical background for Shawnee County and I guess, in connection with 

this, also the Topeka wage area. 

So what we have provided here is a list of the counties that were initially in the 

Topeka wage area back in 1972 when the Federal Wage System was established, and you will 

see on there that Shawnee County was the only survey county. There were a number of counties, 

three counties to be exact, that were added around later, one in around 1975 and two around 

1983 to the survey area. The two added around 1983 were added in reaction to a GAO audit or 

review of how the Federal Wage System was operating, and that was also following a—it would 

have been the 1980 Census, I believe, which was also looked into and the impact it had on 

metropolitan area definitions. So that's really all that document is. 

MR. SHORE: The red are the ones that were added after the original 

establishment. Is that it? 

MR. ALLEN: Yeah, that's right. 

I don't believe there have been any changes in the area of application since the 

wage area was first established, other than removing three counties for putting in the survey area. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any other questions on this new document or on this 

 
 

6 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So I guess we'll defer further discussion till next 

issue? 

month. 

I have a few questions about this interesting background information, but I won't 

take time in here on them. 

All right. That brings up item (b) under Old Business, the definition of Lane 

County, Oregon, to a nonappropriated fund Federal Wage System wage area, 613-MGT-2, and 

the additional information which was prepared on that, 614-OPM-2, where Sacramento was 

thrown into the mix as a comparison to the Pierce NAF wage area. Are we ready to make a 

decision on this one? Any discussion of it? 

MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chairman, I can just give a brief recap on this— 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Sure. 

MR. ALLEN: —to say how we arrived and where we're at now. 

Under the nonappropriated fund system, we define counties where Federal Wage 

System employees work primarily based on the distance to the nearest host installation. 

So, VA informed us that there were now two employees working for the VA 

Canteen Service in Lane County, Oregon, and that requires defining Lane County to a 

nonappropriated fund wage area. 

In 613-MGT-2, our analysis did not address the Sacramento wage area, which is 

to the south of Lane, and in 614-OPM-2, at the request of the Labor members, we did that 

analysis and found that it's around 239 miles to Joint Base Lewis-McCord, which is in the Pierce, 

Washington, survey area. The Sacramento survey area is around 477 miles away. So, on that 

 
 

7 

basis, the original recommendation from the Management members stands that Lane County 

should be added to the Pierce, Washington, nonappropriated fund wage area as an area of 

application. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any questions or discussion about this one? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, is there a consensus to adopt the 

recommendation to add Lane County, Oregon, to the Pierce, Washington, NAF wage area? Is 

there a consensus on that? 

MS. ARCHER: My big concern about this is that the person who raised this issue 

is not present or on the phone. So I'm a little concerned about moving forward until we see if 

there's been—if she has more questions. So I think that I'd like to table this until the next 

meeting, if that's possible. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any objection to doing that? 

MR. SHORE: Okay. 

MR. ALLEN: No objection. 

In this case, the employees, they are already being paid from the Pierce, 

Washington, wage schedule. 

MS. ARCHER: So it wouldn't change anything. Right. I just know that we asked 

specifically for the distance, and considering Jacque isn't here to ask any questions she may have 

about that, I think that we just need to table that until the next time. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I would appreciate it if you could get her to focus on 

this one. 

MS. ARCHER: I will. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Thank you. 

 
 

8 

All right. Well, that brings up several New Business items, (b) through (e), all of 

which relate to defining counties to nonappropriated fund wage areas. So I guess we'll just go in 

the order in which we have them in the agenda starting with 614-MGT-1, Definition of Forsyth 

and Mecklenburg Counties, North Carolina, to a nonappropriated fund Federal Wage System 

wage area. 

Mark, would you like to summarize that one for us, please? 

MR. ALLEN: We've got four wage area redefinition proposals here that are very 

similar in nature. They're all caused by VA Canteen Service having employees now that they did 

not have in the past in new locations. I imagine they're probably with snack bars or coffee bars in 

VA Medical Centers or outpatient clinic. Is that correct? 

MS. MONTGOMERY: I am going to have to ask. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. So Forsyth and Mecklenburg Counties in North Carolina, 

seven employees in Forsyth County, seven employees in Mecklenburg County. 

We took a look at distance, which would be in—we also have the usual maps that 

fit the geographic perspective on these. When we took a look at the distance criteria, we found 

that the closest county—the closest survey county for both Forsyth and Mecklenburg is 

Cumberland County, and when looking on the map, Mecklenburg is just south, a little bit 

southwest of Rowan County, and Forsyth is two counties north of Rowan County. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any questions? 

MR. SHORE: Yeah. Is that the only wage area that was looked into? Is there 

nothing else nearby? I only see Cumberland. 

MR. ALLEN: In this package, we don't have an analysis of distance to other wage 

areas. There are other wage areas, nonappropriated fund wage areas in North Carolina, but they 

 
 

9 

would be further away distance-wise than Cumberland. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: What about to the west, west of that? 

MR. ALLEN: I don't have that information in front of me. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Are you saying you'd like to see some comparison to 

other— 

MS. ARCHER: Yeah. I think that it would be helpful to see what the other areas 

were. Let me just also ask a question. Are these folks already on the Cumberland? 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. 

MS. ARCHER: So this is just making it formal? 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is that something we can— 

MR. ALLEN: yes. We can look into— 

MR. ARCHER: The map is not large enough to sort of get a sense of what else 

might be out there. 

MR. SHORE: Do you know if they've actually—in looking at the beginning, it 

says, "We'll soon have seven employees." Have they actually been hired yet and are under 

Cumberland, or is this something that is going to happen? I know this was from a month ago. 

MR. ALLEN: Madeline, do you remember? Will they be hired soon? 

MS. GONZALEZ: I think it is October. 

MR. ALLEN: October. Okay. 

MS. ARCHER: So, at the moment, they are not covered under any area. 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. I think in this case, there currently are no employees there, but 

I am not certain about that. 

 
 

10 

MS. ARCHER: So, yeah, I think it would just be helpful to have another map 

determining where the next wage area would be. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So why don't we just save that for subsequent 

analysis and have that comparison prepared for the Committee. 

MR. ALLEN: Looking at the package for Pitt County, the other wage areas in 

North Carolina are actually to the east of Cumberland. So I'm guessing that we'd be looking at 

wage areas either in South Carolina or maybe even as far as Georgia. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: There is nothing to the west in North Carolina? 

MR. ALLEN: We will take a look at it and see what the next nearest wage area is. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: That brings up 614-MGT-2, the definition of Pitt 

County, North Carolina, to a NAF wage area. Would you summarize that one, Mark, please? 

MR. ALLEN: This one is a little bit different. There are currently three VA 

employees in Pitt County, and we understand from VA that there was a decision made locally to 

pay the employees from the Cumberland wage schedule. What the Management proposal here 

does, again, based on distance to the nearest host installation, we believe that it would be 

appropriate to define Pitt County to the Wayne, North Carolina, wage area. The reason for that is 

that Cumberland County is much further away than Wayne County. Somebody would most 

likely have to drive through Wayne County to get to Cumberland County. 

MS. ARCHER: Is there a reason why the VA installation chose the Cumberland 

wage area instead of the Wayne wage area, the rationale behind it? 

MR. ALLEN: This is an outpatient clinic to a VA Medical Center. It's in 

Cumberland County. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: It is a satellite of Durham, the document says. 

 
 

11 

MR. ALLEN: Oh, Durham? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yeah. So they are paying people based on Durham, 

which is Cumberland. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. So the two choices here were either Wayne or Craven, and 

Wayne County is a little bit closer, about 20 miles closer than Craven County is to Pitt County. 

Cumberland County would be considerably further away. 

MS. ARCHER: In terms of the satellite office, it's attached to Durham, isn't it? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: That's what it says, yeah. That may be why the 

decision was made initially to pay them from Cumberland. 

MS. ARCHER: There is also nothing in here that I can see, although maybe I 

missed it, that gives us more information about the Durham area in terms of when we're not—

there's commuting patterns. I guess I'm concerned about the fact that the satellite office, there 

might be some movement of workers back to that Durham area or some sort of personnel 

interchange. 

MR. ALLEN: It looks like, based on the map scale, it would be around 120 miles 

to Durham from Pitt County, which is about three times the distance to Wayne. These positions 

are food service worker positions. So chances of somebody being attracted to work, it's more 

likely to be very local rather than to a labor market that's that far away. 

But apart from that, the nonappropriated fund wage area is under OPM's 

regulatory criteria to be defined based on distance to the nearest host installation or nearest 

federal activity. In this case, that's Wayne County. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Do you want more time on this one? 

MS. ARCHER: I do need more time on this one, just noting that this would be—

 
 

12 

these people are already employed there. This would be a decline in their wages if they're 

moving from the Cumberland—where they're already defined—into Wayne. 

MR. ALLEN: Unless they are temporary employees, it would be covered by pay 

retention. 

MS. ARCHER: Just for a portion of the time, like 2 years or something. 

MR. ALLEN: Pay retention is indefinite. Grade retention would be for 2 years. 

MS. ARCHER: Do we know if these are temporary employees? 

MR. ALLEN: I don't know the answer. Do you know the answer to that one? 

MS. GONZALEZ: I do not. 

MS. ARCHER: That would be helpful. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If there's other information that you need, please send 

us your specific questions. 

MS. ARCHER: Yeah. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. Why don't we defer this one as well. Let's 

move on to 614-MGT-3. This will be a charm. 

MR. ALLEN: This one will be easy. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Fulton County, Georgia, nonappropriated fund wage 

area. Mark, please summarize. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. I believe Fulton County, Georgia, was at one time defined to 

the Cobb nonappropriated fund wage area. It's part of Atlanta. So, at one time, it was defined. 

Fulton County is adjacent to Cobb County, and based on the distance criterion, we're 

recommending that it be added back to a nonappropriated fund wage area based on employment 

of one employee now. 

 
 

13 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any questions on this one? Can we adopt this 

recommendation? Steve. 

MR. LANDIS: Just a quick clarification. So Fulton used to be Cobb. Whatever 

was there closed, and so they just let it fall off, and now we need to put it back in. 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Right. That's what I understand. 

MR. ALLEN: We did that a few years ago through a process. We were updating 

the regulation, and we were asked to delete a few counties from wage areas because there was no 

DoD employment there. 

The pattern with these, what's really going on is the VA has established more 

outpatient clinics, more community-based hospital activities. 

MS. MONTGOMERY: Yes. 

MR. ALLEN: So that's why they're more food facilities, small-scale food facilities 

popping up in different parts of the country. 

MS. MONTGOMERY: I imagine that's associated with the Secretary's MyVA 

initiatives where they are making a lot of the small facilities more user-friendly and having a lot 

of resources that bigger already facilities have. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So any further questions or discussion on this one? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So let me ask again: Is there a consensus to adopt this 

proposal? 

ATTENDEE: Yes. 

 
 

14 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yes. Okay. So we have adopted 614-MGT-3. Thank 

you. 

And that brings up the last New Business item, 615-MGT-1, definition of Lee 

County, Florida, to a nonappropriated fund wage area, and, Mark, would you please summarize 

that for us. 

MR. ALLEN: In 615-MGT-1, for Lee County, Florida, sort of in layman's terms 

here, our choices were to either define it to the Miami, Florida, area or the Tampa, Florida, area. 

There are two employees currently in Cape Coral, Florida, which his in Lee County, and when 

we took a look at the regulatory criteria, we have the proximity favoring the Hillsborough wage 

area, which is part of the Tampa area. 

And you see on the map—this is the map, Attachment 1—it gives the appearance 

that Lee County is—it looks like it's halfway between the Hillsborough survey area and the 

Miami-Dade survey area—well, actually, no. I think we looked at Monroe, the Monroe survey 

area for this one. 

I am wrong. We looked at all three of them. 

For Lee County, it's 127 miles to MacDill Air Force Base; 173 miles to 

Homestead Air Reserve Base in the Miami-Dade, Florida, survey area,; and the host installation 

for Monroe, Florida, is actually all the way down in Key West, which is 313 miles. So the closest 

host installation turned out to be in the Hillsborough, Florida, nonappropriated fund wage area, 

and based on that, the Management recommendation is to define Lee County to the Hillsborough 

area of application. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there any discussion? 

MR. SHORE: I guess I understand that the regulatory criteria call for it to be 

 
 

15 

defined to the largest host installation. The distance, right? But it looks to me on the map that 

Lee County is actually closer to the Miami-Dade wage area than it is—and maybe it's just the 

visual for me, but it looks to me like it's closer to that wage area than it is to the Hillsborough. 

MR. ALLEN: I suspect that it's got something to do with the road network in that 

part of Florida where there is a big lake, Lake Okeechobee. 

MR. SHORE: Well, I think it's because it's going to Homestead Air Force Base, 

which is on the far edge, all the way in, but if you actually went to the edge of the wage area 

itself, the Miami-Dade wage area, it may not give you the same answer. 

MR. ALLEN: The regulatory criterion in the case of the nonappropriated fund 

areas call for measuring distances from nonappropriated fund employment location to another 

employment location rather than to a boundary of the county. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any other questions or discussion on this one? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there a consensus to adopt the Management 

recommendation? 

MR. LANDIS: Can we discuss it for another 2 minutes? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Certainly. Do you need a caucus? 

MR. LANDIS: Mark, I'm just looking at the pay charts. It generally seems that 

Hillsborough is higher than the other two, anyway; is that correct? 

MR. ALLEN: I haven't looked at the pay tables myself. 

MR. LANDIS: I mean, we've run into this before where some are higher, and it's 

convoluted sometimes, but in general, it looks like the Hillsborough— 

 
 

MR. ALLEN: Lines cross, yes. 

MR. LANDIS: —is generally 

16 

MR. ALLEN: We looked at Grade 2. It's got a 5-cent-per-hour difference between 

Miami and Hillsborough. 

MR. LANDIS: And what's the number of people we have here, and do we know 

what grades they are or anything like that? 

MR. ALLEN: Two, two employees. 

MR. LANDIS: And does it say what grade they are? 

MR. ALLEN: I'm not sure if we have those in here. 

MR. LANDIS: And where are they being paid from right now? 

MR. SHORE: Hillsborough. 

MR. LANDIS: So they are being paid from Hillsborough now. 

MS. ARCHER: And they are existing employees. 

MR. LANDIS: Yeah. I'd like to know what their current pay grade is. 

MR. ALLEN: We’ll get that for next time. 

MR. SHORE: Or the job. I don't see that. 

MR. ALLEN: Yeah, we can get the grade levels and series. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Well, then I guess we should defer this one as well. Is 

that correct? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Well, all right. I don't have any other New Business. 

Does anyone else have any other New Business? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, it would be appropriate for us to adjourn. Is 

 
 

17 

there any objection? 

MR. ERWIN: Motion to adjourn. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Oh, all right. Is there a second? 

ATTENDEE: Second. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any objection? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing none, we are adjourned. Have a good month, 

everyone. See you in September.
