Official for this meeting, OPM. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fellow assigned to OPM. 
 
 
 
everyone has heard by now, but let me add to the list that our 
member, J. David Cox, was elected yesterday as National 
President of AFGE, and I'm sure we all would like to 
congratulate him for that.  There's a brief story about that, 

MR. LANDIS:  Steve Landis, Act. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Thank you, everyone. 
We will start with a few announcements.  I suspect

Carlos, I understand this might be your last FPRAC 

that we added at the last minute to your packets. 
 
meeting.  Maybe toward the end, do you want to say a few 
remarks, if you feel like it? 

[Laughter.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Before you head off to your well-

MR. SAAVEDRA:  Wow!  I'm glad I made it to that. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yeah, it's good to see you. 
Other than that, you have a letter in your packets to 

 
deserved retirement? 
 
 
 
Director Berry from the entire Rhode Island House and Senate 
Delegation in support of the FPRAC recommendation to consolidate 
FWS wage areas that lie within GS locality pay areas.  That's 
577-OC-1. 
 
response to the some 400 letters that he received, largely 
handwritten letters, from FWS workers at Tobyhanna Army Depot in 
Pennsylvania, also in support of that same FPRAC recommendation. 
You previously received the CD-ROM containing all those letters. 
 
Under 577-OC-3, I circulated a link to the Government 
Accountability Office's recent report comparing the various 
Federal pay comparability studies that are floating around.  I 

In addition, under 577-OC-2, you have Director Berry's

And under 577-OC-4, Director Berry received another 

At this point, I would like to ask Jerry if he 

thought that might be of interest as background information to 
people, even though they don't look specifically at the FWS pay 
system. 
 
letter from a Member of Congress, Representative Hinchey in New 
York, also in support of the consolidate wage areas within 
locality pay areas recommendation. 
 
wouldn't mind updating the committee on the status of that 
issue.. 
 
 
AFGE about the FPRAC recommendation, towards the bottom, the 
Director said, "I am now carefully evaluating all the 
information provided to me," and then he goes on to say the next 
steps, after he is satisfied, will be in the hands of the Office 
of Management and Budget.  I note that that letter was signed on 
August 14th, and I was hoping today, August 16th, a couple days 
later, maybe I would be able to provide an update.  And I'm 
sorry that I cannot.  What you have on August 14th is the 
latest. 
 

MR. MIKOWICZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
If you notice on your handout, 577-OC-2, the letter to 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Well, thank you.

MR. ALLEN:  I believe that Charlie and I had a 

It originated in 1862 in naval shipyards during the 

Last week Mark Allen brought to my attention that this 

 
appears to be the 150th anniversary of the Federal Prevailing 
Rate Pay System, and we hatched a little idea we want to share 
with people.  So, Mark, why don't you tell people about that. 
 
discussion about the history of the prevailing rate concept 
within the Federal Government quite a number of years ago.  It 
may have been around the 140th anniversary of the concept.  I 
think it is a concept that has worked very well.  It's stood the 
test of time. 
 
Civil War, but we're not aware that a whole lot of academic 
research has been done into how the pay of Federal blue collar 
workers has been maintained over the years. 
 
I came across what looked like the beginnings of a 
doctoral dissertation that somebody from Columbia University 
worked on, but we had an idea -- Sheldon and I talked about this 
-- that it might be a good idea to suggest to somebody in the 
academic community that it become a subject for further 
investigation. 
 
across had to do with the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard, which, of 

The particular doctoral dissertation that I came

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We are thinking there are folks 

So I guess we wanted to throw out the idea to get the 

course, is long gone, as are a lot of the other shipyards.  I 
think there's a lot of history behind how labor made those 
shipyards work and made other Federal activities work well. 
 
Committee's opinion if you think it's a good idea to put a 
suggestion out there to have a graduate student who might be 
interested in a general area of labor history to write 
something. 
 
right in town here.  So, for example, at Georgetown University, 
there is a very good labor historian that has students who might 
be looking for topics, but we don't want to start exploring this 
without the Committee's input and concurrence. 
 
interesting study, Mr. Chairman. 
 
Federal Government took place at one of those shipyards, and a 
couple of years after that, the unionized shipyards were getting 
a better deal than the nonunionized shipyards.  I think that 
could be an interesting subject for study.  I'd like to read it 
when it's done. 
 

MR. BERNHARDT:  I think it could be a really 

One of the earliest recorded strikes against the 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any other thoughts on that? 

 

10 

MR. FISHER:  Do we have an idea how we publicize or 

 
request interest from people that might want to write it or look 
at the issue? 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I think we'd probably get ideas 
 
about that from some of the professors we'd contact.  I know, 
for example, that they have professional organization of labor 
historians.  The Labor Historians have their professional 
organization with a LISTSERV, and they could put the word out 
that way, asking if there is any student who might be interested 
in this topic. 
I think once it looks like this might be of interest, 
 
if it does look like it's going to be of interest, we could also 
share something in writing with the Committee, and people on the 
Committee might have ideas about how to publicize it as well. 
 
I will work on that. 
 
That brings up the approval of the transcript from our 
last meeting.  Are there any other changes or edits beyond those 
that people have already sent in to Madeline? 
 
 
transcript? 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any objection to adopting the 

So unless somebody thinks it's a bad idea,  Mark and

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing none, the transcript is 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Just leave them in the work group 

 
 
adopted. 
We have a number of Old Business items, most of which 
 
have been moved over into our work group that's going to convene 
after the end of this meeting, but if there's any of these old 
business items that people want to discuss in here now, we 
certainly can do that.  So the floor is open. 
 
 
then?  Okay. 
 
definition of the Rochester, Minnesota, Metropolitan Statistical 
Area, 577-MGT-1, which people should have received in advance. 
 
 
briefly.  I think it's most likely one we'll have consensus on. 
 
between the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, and Southwestern Wisconsin 
wage areas.  Dodge, Olmstead, and Wabasha Counties, MN, comprise 
the Rochester, MN MSA.  Dodge and Olmstead Counties are part of 
the area of application of the Minneapolis-St. Paul wage area 

Mark, would you summarize that one for us, please? 
MR. ALLEN:  Sure.  I'll cover this one just very 

We have one New Business item, and that's the 

The Rochester, Minnesota, MSA is currently split 

 

12 

and Wabasha County is part of the area of application of the 
Southwestern Wisconsin wage area.  We have a map associated with 
this package.  There are no employees affected by the 
recommendation.  The management members recommend that Wabasha 
County be redefined to the Minneapolis-St. Paul wage area based 
on an analysis of the regulatory criteria.  Redefining Wabasha 
County to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of application would 
place the entire Rochester, MN MSA in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
wage area.  There are 33 Federal wage system employees who are 
located in Olmsted County, which is already in the Minneapolis-
St. Paul wage area.30 of those employees work at the Bureau of 
Prisons with 29 employees being members of AFGE, and 3 employees 
work at the Department of the Army, with 2 employees being 
members of ACT. 
 
 
reviewed it. 
 
Are you there? 
 
haven't had a chance to really look at it.  So I don't have any 
comments.  Sarah didn't leave me with any instructions on this, 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any questions or discussion? 
Steve Fisher:  I didn't have any issue with it.  I 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Gina, have you looked at that one? 

MS. LIGHTFOOT-WALKER:  Yeah, I'm here, and, no, I 

 

13 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We're light on our numbers here 

MS. LIGHTFOOT-WALKER:  Sorry? 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We're a little bit short on 

MR. ALLEN:  I think that's okay.  We don't have --
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I'm going to find out why people -

All right.  Well, that being the case, unless there's 

so --
 
today. 
 
 
numbers of members here today.  I don't know.  Maybe we should 
just defer this one. 
 
 
- why we're a little bit shorthanded. 
 
-- any other New Business? 
 
 
you. 
 
 
and thank you for many years of service.  Feel free to say 
anything you want to say at this point. 
 
while, because I'm really good at doing nothing, I'm going to do 
nothing and enjoy it, and then I'll see what I choose to do, but 

MR. SAAVEDRA:  Well, thank you. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I hope you've got some good plans, 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, Carlos, we're going to miss 

MR. SAAVEDRA:  What I've been telling folks for a 

 

14 

thank you.  It's been great, all the folks that I worked with 
here at FPRAC through the years, and it's been a privilege 
representing the Department of the Navy. 
 
at DoD and the Navy.  So I'm a DoD guy, and I'll leave it at 
that, but thank you.  Good luck to all of you.  I hope you enjoy 
doing nothing as much as I'm going to. 

I began my career with Air Force and worked with folks 

[Laughter.] 
MR. SAAVEDRA:  At least for a while. 
MR. ALLEN:  Thanks for everything, Carlos. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Jim? 
MR. BRADY:  Yes.  If you don't mind, I'd like to say a 

 
 
 
 
few words for the Department of Defense. 
 
Defense couldn't be here today.  He was called to an urgent 
meeting early this morning, but Carlos, we thank you for your 
service, your interest, and all of your contributions over the 
years.  Your service has been absolutely exemplary, and our 
gratitude is immense.  Thank you very much. 
 
 
 

We regret that the FPRAC member for the Department of 

MR. SAAVEDRA:  Thank you. 
MR. BRADY:  And good luck. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  All right.  Well, there are no 

 

15 

other New Business items, and if there's no objection to 
adjourning, we can do that. 
 
 
adjourned, and then in 10 minutes, we'll have a work group 
meeting. 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  And hearing no objection, we're
