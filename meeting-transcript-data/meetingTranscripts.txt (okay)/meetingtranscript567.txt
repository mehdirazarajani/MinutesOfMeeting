everyone. 
 
make that a short part of the agenda.  Does anyone else? 
[No audible response.] 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, we actually have two 
 
sets of minutes or transcripts to approve.  I apologize for 
the typo -- oh, it got corrected.  Okay.  I had an earlier 
version.  Never mind.  From the two meetings ago and the 
 

I don't have any announcements, so that's going to

Has everyone had a chance to review the transcript 

MR. SHULMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I see nods.  Okay.  It's 

And has everyone had a chance to review the 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, is there agreement to 

prior meeting, I guess we should discuss these separately. 
 
from the 565th meeting, and are there any other changes 
beyond those that have already been sent in to us? 
 
 
adopt the transcript? 
 
 
agreed.  Excellent. 
 
transcript of the last meeting?  Are there any other changes 
beyond those that have already been sent in to us? 
 
 
transcript is adopted, too.  Thank you very much. 
 
We have a number of old business items.  I think 
all but one are really in the -- well, all but possibly two 
are in the purview of the work group, but (e) is something 
we could talk about today, abolishment of Montgomery, 
Pennsylvania, as a nonappropriated fund wage area. 
 
We've been pondering this for a couple of meetings 
now.  The Management side has informed me, they're going to 
 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  So, hearing no objection, that

MR. ALLEN:  I do have something to update 

be a little short-handed today.  So, if we actually came to 
a vote on something, we'd have to wait until next month to 
vote, but we can certainly discuss this one if anyone wants 
to. 
 
everybody on.  At our last meeting, OPM staff were asked to 
look back at some of the rationales for previous 
nonappropriated fund wage area abolishment.  We're still in 
the process of doing that, but at this point, we've gone 
back to around 1994 to identify which counties were 
redefined to which wage areas.  Now the next part of this is 
to figure out what the rationale behind each one actually 
was. 
 
What I've looked at so far seems to indicate that 
FPRAC has been very flexible.  I wasn't actually surprised 
with that.  There have been different rationales at 
different points for different wage areas that we need to 
take a closer look at to see if there are really any 
discernable patterns between how counties are defined to 
other survey areas once a wage area is abolished. 
 
where the cluster of counties that had previously been 
together was retained as a cluster? 
 

MS. SIMON:  Are you specifically looking for cases

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, I would suggest we

MR. ALLEN:  Yes. 
MS. SIMON:  Okay. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any other discussion today on 

 
 
 
this one? 
 
 
defer it to the next meeting. 
 
next meeting on this. 
 
wants to bring up about item (f) under old business at this 
point? 
 
 
 
 
anyone else? 
 
 
we would like to do so. 
 
record that we do have a working group meeting -- 
 
 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Defer that one?  Okay. 
This could be a record, in my short tenure anyway. 
Well, I don't have any new business items.  Does

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, we could adjourn, if 

MR. ALLEN:  I would just like to note for the

MR. ALLEN:  -- after this meeting, so we'll 

 
probably be in there for quite a while. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  And I think it's a good day 
for us to have a lot of time for that.  After we adjourn, 
we'll take a 5-minute break and reconvene in the Small 
Pendleton Room for the working group meeting. 
 
 
 
 
 
objection -- is there no objection? 
 
 
adjourned.  Thank you.  See you in 5 minutes. 
 

Is there a motion to adjourn? 
MR. SHULMAN:  Motion to adjourn.
