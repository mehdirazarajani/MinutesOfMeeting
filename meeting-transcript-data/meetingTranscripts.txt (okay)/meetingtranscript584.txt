CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, good morning, everyone, 

MR. ALLEN:  Mark Allen with OPM. 
MR. RUMBLE:  Steve Rumble, Department of Defense. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I believe we have a 

 
and welcome to this, our 584th meeting of the Federal 
Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee.  My name is Sheldon 
Friedman, Chair of the Committee, and as usual, why don't 
we go around and introduce ourselves, so let's start with 
you today, Mark. 
 
 
 
Management member on the phone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
introduce themselves. 
 
Officer. 
 

MR. BOB KERR:  It is Bob Kerr from Air Force. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you. 
And here? 
MR. SHORE:  Robert Shore from NAGE. 
MR. LANDIS:  Steve Landis from ACT. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you. 
And people around the sides of the room can 

MS. ROBERTS:  Brenda Roberts, Designated Federal 

MS. JACOBSON:  Jeanne Jacobson, OPM.

MR. FENDT:  Karl Fendt, DoD. 
MR. BRADY:  Jim Brady, DoD. 
MR. EICHER:  Mike Eicher, OPM. 
MS. GONZALEZ:  Madeline Gonzalez with OPM. 
MS. DORSEY:  Jennifer Dorsey, OPM. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you. 
Well, we obviously don't have a quorum, so we 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can't take any votes, but we can probably get a few things 
done that we need to get done today. 
 
People have in their folder the memorandum about 
Prevailing Rate Pay Adjustments for Fiscal Year 2013.  I'd 
be astonished if there were any questions about it, but if 
there are, fire away. 
 
something for the record about this and say what it 
actually is. 
 
Wage System has been operating under pay caps, and part of 
what this memorandum does is continue that policy of 
capping, but the cap is actually zero percent for the rest 
of this fiscal year and for the preceding part of the 
fiscal year from today. 

MR. ALLEN:  Mr. Chairman, I probably should say 

Every year since Fiscal Year 1978, the Federal 

 

 
5 

Typically, what happens with Federal Wage System 

 
OPM issued this memorandum to agencies to provide 
them with instructions on how to issue wage schedules under 
the pay freeze legislation, and this memorandum covers only 
Fiscal Year 2013.  The pay freeze extends through the 
remainder of this calendar year. 
 
adjustments is that there is appropriations legislation 
that covers whether there's a pay cap or what we also call 
a floor increase, which is also referred to in this 
memorandum.  Those provisions would usually be contained in 
an appropriations law that may or may not pass before the 
end of this fiscal year.  Typically, they don't pass that 
early, but I'm always hopeful that the Congress will pass 
legislation for these provisions at some point in this 
calendar year. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any discussion?  Questions? 
 
[No audible response.] 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, let's move on to the 
review of the transcript of our March meeting.  I believe 
everybody has a copy of that in your packets. 
 
already heard from you about? 

Are there any changes besides those that we've 

 

 
6 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, is there agreement 

And that brings up old business.  We do have 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I see no dissenting nods or 

 
 
that we should adopt the transcript? 
 
 
whatever, so the transcript of our last meeting is adopted. 
Thank you. 
 
quite a few old business items.  Are there any that people 
would like to discuss today? 
 
 
 
suggestions. 
 
to do with wage area redefinitions based on changes in 
Metropolitan Statistical Area definitions.  OPM is now in 
receipt of the new MSA definitions, so what I would 
actually recommend is we get in touch with the other 
members who are not here today just to withdraw some of 
these items from the agenda and at some point in the future 
replace them once we've had a chance to look at the new MSA 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, we can defer those. 
MR. ALLEN:  Actually, I have a couple of 

There are a few items of old business that have

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Do you know now if any of the 

MR. ALLEN:  We have not looked at them in detail 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Seems to me, we ought to 

definitions, which may impact some of these.  We don't want 
to approve something that's out of date. 
 
changes affect any of the pending old business items? 
 
yet. 
 
narrow that just to those where we know it's --
 
MR. ALLEN:  We also have new commuting patterns. 
So, in one way or another, these proposals that are on the 
agenda now are out of date because we're relying on 
commuting patterns from the year 2000, the 2000 Census. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  All right.  Well, 
maybe if you could let us know exactly which ones you think 
ought to be withdrawn pending updated MSA and commuting 
data? 
 
 
 
 
old business that people would like to bring up now? 
 

Any question about that or discussion? 
MR. RUMBLE:  No. 
MR. LANDIS:  No. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Anything else under 

MR. LANDIS:  Yeah.  I'd just like to ask -- I 

 

8 
 

MR. LANDIS:  Can you spell his last name for me, 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  It's a woman.  Elaine. 
MR. LANDIS:  Oh, Elaine.  I'm sorry.  I thought 

know, I understand we're getting or have new directors now 
of OPM and maybe even OMB. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, there's an Acting 
Director here, Elaine Kaplan, who had been the General 
Counsel of OPM. 
 
please? 
 
 
you said "Lane."  I'm sorry. 
 
 
to respond to that? 
 
couple of weeks ago.  I believe her name is Burwell. 
 
 
 
too new.  Have we gotten any feedback on them on their 
opinion of the report we filed last year that I keep 
bringing up at every meeting? 
 

MR. LANDIS:  "Burwell" or "Birdwell" 
MR. ALLEN:  "Bur," B-u-r-w-e-l-l. 
MR. LANDIS:  Have we got any -- I'm sure they're 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  K-a-p-l-a-n. 
And OMB, there are changes also -- anybody want 

MR. ALLEN:  OMB's new director was confirmed a 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I don't have anything new 

 

 

 
9 

MR. ALLEN:  No decision has been rendered on that 

MR. LANDIS:  Okay. 
I had one other thing. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Sure, go ahead. 
MR. LANDIS:  More of old stuff here.  I had 

from them, but I haven't had any conversations with them 
about this matter. 
 
by OPM yet. 
 
 
 
 
somebody give me this.  This is more specific now to the 
situation at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, and this is 
just -- it was in a newspaper article, and it was talking 
about back in 2009, the impending new Joint Base that they 
were creating.  And it was talking about then efforts by 
Congressman John Adler, the late John Adler, and the Office 
of Personnel Management announce the Joint Base will 
include the new higher New York locality pay.  Official 
said this new rule is an important step toward ensuring 
that all Federal civilian employees at Joint Base will be 
paid equally for the same job, and this will go into effect 
October 11th, 2009. 
 
we all know that that never got done. 

And, obviously, I brought this up many times, and 

 

 
10 

MR. LANDIS:  Yeah, I can do that, if you like. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Sure.  Can you send it?  Give 

MR. LANDIS:  Okay. 
MS. GONZALEZ:  Can I keep that copy? 
MR. LANDIS:  That's the only one I have, 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Is that a newspaper article? 
 
MR. LANDIS:  Yes. 
 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Would you like that submitted 
for the record and circulated to the Committee?  We can do 
that. 
 
 
it to Madeline, please. 
 
 
 
unfortunately. 
 
 
that, you can just send us a link. 
 
It's old.  I don't know if it will even be there, but I can 
see if I can find it. 
 
link still works, I’ll send it to Madeline. 
 
that to our attention. 

MS. GONZALEZ:  Okay. 
MR. ALLEN:  Is it an Internet article?  If it's 

MR. LANDIS:  Okay.  I could probably do that. 

 

The link is right at the bottom.  If the 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, thanks for bringing 

 

 
11 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Mm-hmm. 
MR. LANDIS:  I think, it's page 14.  I 

MR. LANDIS:  Okay. 
 
And the other thing is something we have 
 
discussed before on our Survey Issues Workgroup --
 
 
highlighted the area we're talking about, I guess, the 
policy has generally been to keep FWS employees in National 
Forests, National Parks, and military installations on the 
same wage area, and when these issues are brought before 
OPM's attention, they're dealt with on an ad hoc basis. 
And, again, you know, that's something that was never done 
here at McGuire. 
 
I keep bringing these things up because, you 
know, this is the number-one issue back there, and it's 
hurting, it's hurting morale back there, and there's people 
that are leaving the position down there to find employment 
elsewhere because of that. 
 
know we have done pretty much -- and you've said this 
before.  We've done pretty much everything we can do here, 
but I just like to keep that -- you know, put it in the 
record and keep it to the attention of everyone.  It's 

So I just wanted to bring these things up.  I 

 

 
12 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I'm happy to entertain any 

something that's gone on 3 1/2, almost 4 years now that 
this -- that the wage area change that was promised was 
never dealt with, and I just was hoping there was something 
that we could do maybe to urge someone to make some kind of 
decision on this. 
 
specific suggestion about what else we could do. 
 
MR. LANDIS:  I don't --
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We've recommended as a 
Committee to our Director that the matter be fixed --
 
MR. LANDIS:  Mm-hmm. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: -- in the context of a larger 
change in regulation, but if there's something else you can 
think of or we can think of to do --
 
have the two new -- the Acting Director and the new 
Director of OMB.  Maybe it's something that we could run by 
them now.  I'm sure they may not even be aware of this 
situation.  Maybe they have a different outlook on fixing 
it. 
 
But I know that a lot of times, it's brought up 
that we can't really do anything until the pay freeze is 

MR. LANDIS:  I don't know.  Just maybe like we 

 

 
13 

And, again, it's not an increase in the wage 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Right. 
MR. LANDIS:  So I don't see that that should have 

done, but, obviously, this occurred well before the pay 
freeze was implemented. 
 
 
any effect on it. 
 
grade pay.  It's just a change, which we've done, you know, 
many times since then, and we have seen reports of other 
areas that had effect on people that put them into a higher 
wage area since this time. 
 
And that's another thing that's very frustrating 
to people back at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  They 
read these articles in other areas getting these wage area 
upgrades, and they don't know why they're being overlooked 
for all this time. 
 
maybe we can think of something else we can do. 
 
up? 
 
 
people would like to discuss? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yeah.  Well, thank you, and 

Anything else on this point that Steve brought 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any other old business item 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Oh, I'm sorry.  We have a 

MS. BOYD:  Yes.  Stephanie Boyd from VA. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you for

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  And if not, we have no new 

 
 
business items on the agenda, but are there any others that 
people want to bring up? 
 
 
Committee member who didn't get a chance to introduce 
herself earlier. 
 
 
coming.  Okay. 
 
 
 
objection, we could adjourn. 
 
 
adjourned.  Thank you all.  See you in June. 
 

Any new business? 
[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Well, if there is no 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing no objection, we're
