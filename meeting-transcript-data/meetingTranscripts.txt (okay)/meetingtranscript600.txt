P R O C E E D I N G 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Well, good morning, everyone, and 
welcome to this, our 600th, meeting of the Federal Prevailing 
Rate Advisory Committee. I guess that's quite a milestone for 
us. My name is Sheldon Friedman, Chair of the Committee. 

As we always do, let's go around the room and 

introduce ourselves. We'll start with you, Bill. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: Bill Fenaughty, Metal Trades Division 

and NFFE. 

MS. ARCHER: Candace Archer, AFGE. 

MR. LANDIS: Steven Landis, ACT. 

MR. ALLEN: Mark Allen with OPM. 

MR. DAVEY: Jim Davey with DoD. 

MR. PEDERSEN: Dave Pedersen with Navy. 

MS. ROMBA: Arleen Romba with VA. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And I understand we have at least 

one member on the phone today. Would you please introduce 
yourself? Can you hear me? 

MS. SIMON (via phone): Yeah. This is Jacque Simon from 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is anyone else on the phone? 

AFGE. 

 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Who else were we expecting on the 

5 

phone? 

MS. GONZALEZ: Pamela Sokol from Army and Adair Gregory 

from NAGE. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: We've got four on each side, 

including Jacque, so I think we can get started. 

Why don't people around the room also introduce 

themselves? 

MS. JACOBSON: Jeanne Jacobson, OPM, Designated Federal 

Officer. 

MR. LYNCH: Luis Lynch, Air Force. 

MR. BRADY: Jim Brady, DoD. 

MR. COLLINS: Donovan Collins, VA. 

MR. HUNTER: Thurstan Hunter, VA. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Madeline Gonzalez with OPM. 

MR. EICHER: Mike Eicher, OPM. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And I think someone may have just 

joined us on the phone. Could you please -- 

MR. GREGORY (via phone): Yes. This is Adair Gregory 

with NAGE. 

 

6 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay, welcome. 

MR. GREGORY (via phone): Thank you. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So I have distributed a couple of 

announcements. 

First is my response to a letter we got in August from 

Senator Brown of Ohio regarding a matter that was brought to 
FPRAC's attention back in 2010. We distributed the incoming 
letter from Senator Brown at an earlier meeting. 

Also -- and I think people are aware of this already, 

but I have circulated the letter from Brenda Roberts of OPM 
regarding approval of special rates for non-appropriated fund 
FWS positions at the Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. 

Any questions about either of those? 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, we could go on to the 
review of the transcript of our last meeting. Are there any 
other corrections beyond those that we've heard from you about 
for the transcript of that meeting? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, is there any objection to 

adopting that transcript? 

[No audible response.] 

 

7 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing no objection, the 
transcript of our last meeting is adopted. Thank you. 

And that brings up Old Business. Is there anything 
that people want to discuss about items (a) through (d) under 
Old Business? 

MS. ARCHER: I guess the motion that we have included 
here about the Mississippi Lakes project would fall under Old 
Business -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: (e). 

MS. ARCHER: (e), yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yes. So I'm asking if anybody wants 

to deal with (a) through (d). 

MS. ARCHER: Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: That's okay. 

Hearing -- 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. So let's move on to (e). Yes, 

Candace. Your motion certainly does fall under (e), and that's 
the issue regarding the Lake employees in the Northern 
Mississippi wage area. 

 

8 

We have before us the review prepared by OPM staff of 

the two counties in which those Lakes are located, which we 
distributed at the last meeting. 

We also have a very useful list of FPRAC 

recommendations in recent years in cases where there are closely 
located or closely related Federal activities that straddle 
county lines. 

And we understand that AFGE has a proposal it wants to 

make on this matter as well. 

So the floor is open on this issue. We started a 

discussion the last time. We had also very good, helpful input 
from local management about the Lakes Project. The floor is 
open. Who wants it? 

MS. ARCHER: Well, I guess I'll start. We made this 

motion I think at the last meeting. This is just formally making 
sure that it's in writing and people can see exactly what we're 
moving for, and I think we had a robust discussion last time. We 
heard from management in the Lake Projects, and management 
seemed to suggest that this was something that would be cost 
effective, would also be fair to employees, would increase 
morale, and would allow them better ability to manage their 
workforce. So that's the reason for our motion, and I'm not sure 
if -- 

 

9 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Why don't you start by stating the 

motion? 

MS. ARCHER: Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I think we're getting slightly 

ahead into the -- 

MS. ARCHER: Okay. AFGE moves that the special wage 

schedule be established for the workers of the Mississippi Lake 
Project, so that employees of the four project offices are paid 
on the same pay scale and receive the prevailing rate for the 
Memphis pay area due to the unique circumstances of their work. 

By unique circumstances of their work -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Let's hold it. We'll get to 

discussion of the motion shortly. 

MS. ARCHER: Sorry. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there a second? 

MR. LANDIS: I'll second. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. It has been moved and 

seconded that a special wage schedule be established for the 
workers at the Mississippi Lakes project, so employees at the 
four project offices are paid on the same scale and receive the 
prevailing rate for the Memphis wage area due to the unique 
circumstances of their work. 

 

10 

The floor is now open for discussion. If you want to 

have the floor first and explain why -- 

MS. ARCHER: Sure. My apologies. I was jumping a bit. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: -- you're proposing this -- 

MS. ARCHER: Like I said, I think we had a robust 

discussion last time. We heard from management how this would 
benefit not only the mission of the project, but also the morale 
of the workers as well as cost effectiveness and management 
flexibility. 

In addition, what we have seen is that the work that 
these folks do is essentially overlapped on all of these sites, 
so it does constitute what we think is one worksite, and so we 
think that this is a proposal that would be -- would actually 
solve the problem that's existed for a very long time in that 
area. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any further discussion? 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. First of all, we have a motion. We may 

have a vote. This is Christmastime. There's a 7-day minority 
report opportunity, and the seventh day happens to be a holiday. 

So I'm suggesting that it's not a good time to vote on 
things, simply because there's a constrained time to perform any 
after-action reports that might happen. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So you're requesting that we defer 

11 

this to another meeting? Is that -- 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Well -- 

MR. DAVEY: A discussion is fine, but I think anything 

voted today would be shortening the time frame for any 
after-action reports due to the holidays coming up. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Just as a side bar, you say the 
seventh day is the holiday and, therefore, a short amount of 
time to do a minority report. 

MR. DAVEY: Right. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is that your understanding of how 

the 7-day rule works, Mark? 

MR. ALLEN: I believe the way the rules as written for 
the Committee's operations after a vote takes place provide that 
the minority members may decide to send in a minority report 
opposing the authority recommendation. The members in the 
minority have 7 days in which to -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: 7 calendar days? 

MS. GONZALEZ: 7 workdays. 

MR. DAVEY: 7 workdays. 

 

12 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: 7 workdays. So, in fact, the fact 

that it's a holiday doesn't shorten the -- 

MR. DAVEY: Except for two of those days happen to be 

holidays. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Right. But then you get an 

additional day after that. 

MR. DAVEY: Oh, because it's workdays. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yeah. Yeah, you get an additional 2 

days. 

MR. DAVEY: Yeah. Well, in addition to the holiday part 

of it, everyone at this time of the year is short-staffed. At 
least within our department, there's lots of holiday taking 
going on -- which reduces the ability of the staff to consider 
all of these items on time. 

So I respectfully request a vote not be taking on 
this, simply because holiday, number one; number two, we're 
short-staffed. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Well, we actually have to 
either vote on that, unless there's a consensus. Is there a 
consensus to defer this one month or not? 

MR. ALLEN: Until January? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Until January. 

 

MS. ARCHER: I don't think there's a consensus. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So then we need -- okay. So you 

have essentially made a motion -- 

13 

MR. DAVEY: I make a motion to -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: -- to defer it -- 

MR. DAVEY: -- to defer it -- 

 CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: -- for a month. 

MR. DAVEY: Yeah. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: You guys are going to make me 
become an expert on Robert’s Rules of Order -- I'm not -- I 
don't want to be. 

I believe that's a debatable motion. So is there any 

debate on postponing till next month? 

MS. SIMON (via phone): Sheldon, this is Jacque. Is 

there a quorum present? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yes. 

MS. SIMON (via phone): Okay. Well, then I just would 

like to speak in opposition to the motion. These people have 
been waiting a really long time. Years, not months. This is not 
a new issue for FPRAC. We have discussed this. We have studied 
this. We have spent an inordinate amount of time on this issue. 

 

14 

We have all the information before us and have had 
that information before us for months, if not years, and it's 
certainly time for justice for these workers. And I think any 
kind of delay at this point is just the wrong thing to do. So I 
speak against the delay. 

MR. DAVEY: Well, as far as having information in front 
of us, this concept just showed up recently. What was before us 
before was the concept of a redefinition of a county, and so 
this is a new concept. So I wouldn't agree that we've had time 
to consider this for years and years and years. Until very 
recently, no one had ever spoken of a, quote/unquote, special 
wage schedule for these employees. 

MS. ARCHER: Well -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any additional – yes? 

MS. ARCHER: But you have had a month to consider that, 
and we did make this motion at the last meeting. All we're doing 
now is we're formalizing it. 

MR. DAVEY: Okay. And -- 

MS. ARCHER: So -- and you'll see in the -- you know, 

in the transcript that we made a motion to do this. 

So, you know, I mean, you've had time over the last 

month to look into this and see if this is, you know, 

 

problematic or whatever and come in today ready to move on it or 
not. 

15 

MR. FENAUGHTY: Sheldon? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yeah. Bill? 

MR. FENAUGHTY: I remember what happened at the last 
month's meeting. We could have voted on it then, and then this 
problem wouldn't have existed about this holiday issue. 

The reason that we didn't vote on it last month was 

because the Chair recommended that we put the motion in writing. 
That's the only reason that we didn't vote, because you wanted 
to see something formal in writing. If anybody remembers 
something different than that, I don't. 

MR. DAVEY: And the formal writing showed up within -- 

less than 24 hours ago, is when we saw it. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: That's right, Jimmy, but everybody knew 
what this was about last month. This is just the same words that 
were spoken last month on this -- 

MR. DAVEY: There are many, many motions -- 

MR. FENAUGHTY: -- paper. 

MR. DAVEY: -- that are deferred over time. They all 

aren't voted on instantly for various reasons. 

 

16 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Anybody got any new points to make 

on this? 

MR. DAVEY: I have a question about the -- is this 

something that we're allowed to do? Is it within the purview of 
the FPRAC members to create a -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Well, let's -- 

MR. DAVEY: -- special wage schedule? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Let's deal with -- well, I think we 

got to deal with your motion to postpone first. 

MR. DAVEY: Thank you. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Unless there's a question about the 

main motion, which we're not quite -- 

MR. DAVEY: Okay. 

MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chairman, I do remember in the past -- 
and this is not strictly within the rules of the Committee, but 
there have been times in the past where the period between a 
vote and a minority report being sent in was extended by the 
Chairman or by the agreement of the Committee. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Which is it? Does the Chair have 

the authority to extend that period, or does it require a 
consensus to extend that period? 

 

17 

MR. ALLEN: I believe it would require a consensus 

among the Committee members to do that. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. Well, let's -- so once 
we dispose of the motion or make some decision on the motion to 
postpone, if you then want to propose more time to submit your 
minority report, we can see if there is a consensus. 

But, again, I think, Mark, again, that is still -- and 

after we make a decision on postponing the question. 

MR. ALLEN: Yeah. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there any objection to voting on 
the motion to postpone? Are there any new points people need to 
make about it before we vote on it? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Then I believe we'll -- 

MR. DAVEY: I think we need to second it first. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: On the motion to postpone, 

probably. Is there a second? - 

MR. PEDERSEN: I'll second that. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. So it's been moved and 

seconded to postpone until the January meeting consideration of 
the AFGE motion, which I suppose I'm supposed to read, but you 
know what I'm talking about. 

 

18 

So then I believe we're ready to vote now. 

MS. GONZALEZ: There are four Management members and 

five Labor members, so which Labor member would not vote? 

MS. ARCHER: I'll -- no, I shouldn't do that. Forget 

it. [Laughs.] I have to vote. 

MS. GONZALEZ: I need four and four, so -- 

MR. LANDIS: I guess I can step aside for this vote. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Okay. OPM? 

MR. ALLEN: On the motion to -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yeah. You're supposed to read the 

motion. I'm sorry. Yeah, this is the motion to postpone. I 
thought I said -- this is the motion to postpone until -- 

MS. GONZALEZ: Until January. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: -- January, consideration of the 

AFGE motion. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. Yes. 

MS. GONZALEZ: DoD? 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Navy? 

MR. PEDERSEN: Yes. 

MS. GONZALEZ: VA? 

 

19 

MS. ROMBA: Yes. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Metal Trades? 

MR. FENAUGHTY: No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: AFGE, Candace? 

MS. ARCHER: No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: AFGE, Jacque?  

MS. SIMON (via phone): No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: And NAGE? 

MR. GREGORY (via phone): No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: It's a tie, Mr. Chairman. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. The Chairman votes no but is 

very sympathetic to the idea of giving DoD an extra month for 
its minority report. 

So motion to postpone fails, and we're back to debate 
on the main motion, which is to create a special wage schedule 
for the four Lakes. Would you want to -- 

MR. DAVEY: I'd like to make a motion that deals with 

the postponed time. Is it in order to do that at this point? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is this regarding additional time 

for the minority report? 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yeah, certainly. I think it is. 

20 

I'll just say it's in order. 

MR. DAVEY: Okay. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. DAVEY: I would like to make a motion that the time 
be extended for the minority report on this issue until the next 
meeting, the next January meeting of FPRAC. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. You want another month beyond 

the -- 

window. 

MR. DAVEY: Yeah. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Normally, it would be a 7-day 

MR. DAVEY: 7-day window? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: You want at least 7 days. 

MR. ALLEN: So this would be up through January 15th. 

That's when the next FPRAC meeting is. 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. So it's been moved to allow 

additional time for the minority report until the January 
meeting of FPRAC. Any debate of that? 

MR. DAVEY: Second it? 

 

21 

MR. PEDERSEN: Yes. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: So they got 7 days, and now they want 

37 days. In my mind -- 

MR. DAVEY: Please keep in mind -- please keep in mind 
that it's also use-or-lose time within the government, and the 
actual deadline to use that is January 8th, I believe. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: We didn't make up these time frames, 

Jim. They've been here a long time. 

We may be willing to listen to something just a little 

bit between 37 and 7. 

MR. DAVEY: I understand that what we are saying is -- 

I'm just letting you know that we're short-staffed, and now 
there's additional items that may be required of our staff 
during the time when we're trying to issue wage schedules. 

How many wage schedules do we have to issue? 

MR. BRADY: A couple hundred. 

MR. DAVEY: A couple hundred wage schedules, which 

would be really our priority. 

MR. ALLEN: It's actually only extending about, I 

think, 21 days beyond the 7 days. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: Those are workdays. 

 

22 

MR. DAVEY: Well, I'm not talking workdays. I'm talking 

20 workdays, maybe. 

MR. ALLEN: No. If we're just talking calendar days to 

get it through January 15th, then 7 workdays would take us up 
through -- beyond Christmas, and then it's really only -- 
actually, it's only 2 weeks after that normal deadline. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any other discussion? 

MR. LANDIS: I just have a question. How is this motion 

different than the motion that was just defeated? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Oh. Well, the motion that was 

defeated was to postpone consideration of the AFGE motion until 
the next meeting, January meeting. 

MR. LANDIS: Okay. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: This is a motion to allow -- you 

know what? This actually -- I think we actually -- 

MR. DAVEY: The vote would happen today. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Mm-hmm. 

MR. DAVEY: But it would simply -- well, the first 

motion was to not vote today. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Right. 

MR. DAVEY: But the vote -- 

 

23 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I think what I should have said is 

the motion is out of order until we finish this other motion, 
frankly, but I didn't. So we're talking about it. So let's deal 
with it because it's different from postponing. 

Anyway, they want more time for a minority report. 

Normally, they'd have 7 business days from a decision here, and 
Jim is asking that they have a month for their minority report 
if there needs to be a minority report. 

MR. LANDIS: Right. I understand the technical 

difference. We were voting today as opposed to voting in a 
month, but if they have until next month to do the minority 
report anyway, it would be no different than if we voted on it 
and just went through next month. 

But like Bill was saying, I would have no problem -- I 

mean, again, we would discuss this -- with an additional 7 
business days onto the original 7 business days, but postponing 
it for another -- not postponing it, but waiting for the 
minority report again until the January meeting doesn't sound 
like it -- it's being delayed until the January meeting, one way 
or the other, whether we vote on it today or we vote on it at 
the January meeting. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: You're saying you would accept some 

additional time? 

 

24 

MR. LANDIS: I'm suggesting that's a possibility that 

we would have to discuss on the Labor side. 

MR. DAVEY: The quantity of work that we are required 

to put out over the holidays is enormous. Anything that happened 
from September through now, all those wage schedules are 
required to be issued during this time frame. It's difficult 
with everyone taking holiday leave and holidays taking place as 
well. It's difficult enough to complete that task. 

So, with all due respect, I'd like you all to take 
that into account when we have an additional item to consider 
during that very, very busy time frame. 

MR. ALLEN: I'm just looking at my -- it's actually my 

payroll calendar here. If we had 7 working days between today 
and the date from which the minority report would normally be 
required, it would be -- 

MS. ARCHER: The 31st? 

MR. ALLEN: The 31st is correct. So there would be 10 
additional working days which would lead us up through January 
15th. 

MS. ARCHER: Nine. Right? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is the 7-day rule a regulation? Is 

this something -- 

 

25 

MR. DAVEY: No. It's in the Charter that we have for 

consideration. 

MS. GONZALEZ: It's in the Committee rules. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: It's in the -- well, it is? 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Because we've just been looking at 
Committee rules, and I don't remember seeing anything about -- I 
know I've seen 7 days for minority report somewhere, but it's in 
the Committee rules document that we're looking at? Can you 
point where? 

MS. GONZALEZ: It's in Section V(e). 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Oh, okay. Okay. So it is. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: Sheldon, let me just say this. I mean, 

we're kind of out of order here a little bit. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I think we are, actually. I agree 

with that. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: I mean, we certainly understand what 
Jim is saying in part, but why don't we vote on the motion and 
see if we actually need a -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: That's why we're out of order. No, 

you're absolutely right. I made a goof. This procedure -- 

 

26 

MR. DAVEY: So let's delay this discussion. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: -- it might be moot. It might not 

be moot. We don't know yet. 

So I go back to the main motion. Is there any more 

debate on the main motion? 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. I have a question. We're talking about 

this is the 600th meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate 
Advisory Committee, and I'm trying to recollect when in the past 
600 meetings has FPRAC created a special wage schedule. Really, 
is it within the purview of this Committee to create such a 
special wage schedule? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Well, anything we do is a 

recommendation to the Director. So we don't create anything. I 
mean, everything we do is a recommendation to the Director of 
OPM, so -- 

MR. DAVEY: The recommendations in the past -- well, I 

know that we've talked about redefining areas, but I don't 
recollect any discussion ever within FPRAC to make such a 
recommendation. 

When it comes to a special wage schedule, then that's 

defined in the operating manual of the procedures for that. 

 

27 

I don't know. Mark, do you remember off the top of 
your head whether there is a special wage -- something in the 
operating manual that deals with this? 

MR. ALLEN: It's actually a provision in both the 

operating manual and in regulation that authorizes OPM to create 
special wage schedules, which are different than special rates. 

We actually do have many special wage schedules that 

were developed over the years. A lot of them were developed 
early on in the pay system when we were -- the Civil Service 
Commission was accommodating preexisting practices that agencies 
had, such as -- I think maybe the lock and dam schedule is one. 
There's another special schedule system for Department of the 
Interior overlap schedules. Printing and lithographic employees 
were placed on a series of special schedules because of their 
specialized industry. The foreign areas schedules, those are 
considered to be special wage schedules. And all of those at one 
point or another were recommended to be developed by FPRAC and 
the Civil Service Commission, when OPM first put them into the 
operating manual and then later in the regulations under Title 
5. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any other discussion of the main 

motion? 

 

[No audible response.] 

28 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Are we ready to vote then? 

MR. FENAUGHTY: I'm ready. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Let me state the motion. It's been 

moved that a special wage schedule be established for the 
workers at the Mississippi Lake Projects, so that employees in 
the four -- 

MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chairman, the Management members would 

like to take a brief caucus. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. We are in recess for a 

caucus. 

[Management members go in caucus off the record.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Management has returned from its 

caucus, and we are back in session. 

MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chairman, the Management members have 

some additional discussion points they would like to raise. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. The floor is yours. 

MR. DAVEY: Looking at the motion, the motion describes 
the unique circumstance of their work, this being the employees 
at these Lakes that work for the Corps of Engineers. 

I'm not sure that that's necessarily true. We're aware 

that they have some circumstances, but whether it's unique or 
not, I don't think that we know the answer to that. 

 

29 

I suspect the National Guard people who are within 5 
miles of these people we're talking about have interaction with 
other National Guard members in their states as well, if not 
more so than these people that we're talking about now. 

So I'm concerned about the concept of the organization 

being one of the main drivers of why we're talking about this 
and the application of that concept to the National Guard or 
other organizations as well. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Anything else from your caucus that 

you want to report back to us? 

MR. DAVEY: Anything else? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any further discussion of the 

MR. LANDIS: Now, we -- 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Actually, we had -- oh, you wanted 

motion? 

to -- 

MR. LANDIS: I just wanted to record the vote, is all. 

If that's now, that would be fine. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I think we -- if there's not 

further discussion, go ahead. 

 

30 

MR. LANDIS: I just wanted to say since I won't be 

officially voting here, I just wanted to express ACT's support 
for the motion. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Any further -- I think we did 

this already, but let me ask just one more time. Any further 
discussion of this motion? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, we are ready to vote. Let 
me read the motion. The motion is to establish a special wage 
schedule for the workers at the Mississippi Lake Project, so 
that the employees in four project offices are paid on the same 
scale and receive the prevailing rate of the Memphis pay area 
due to the unique circumstances of their work. That's the 
motion. 

I think we are ready to vote. Madeline? 

MS. GONZALEZ: I will start with Labor this time. Metal 

Trades? 

 

MR. FENAUGHTY: Yes. 

MS. GONZALEZ: AFGE, Candace? 

MS. ARCHER: Yes. 

MS. GONZALEZ: AFGE, Jacque? 

MS. SIMON (via phone): Yes. 

31 

MS. GONZALEZ: NAGE? 

MR. GREGORY (via phone): Yes. 

MS. GONZALEZ: OPM? 

MR. ALLEN: No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: DoD? 

MR. DAVEY: No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Navy? 

MR. PEDERSEN: No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: VA? 

MS. ROMBA: No. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Mr. Chairman, it's a tie. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. The Chair votes yes. 

I believe the location, the nearby location and 

closely related nature of the activity and the interchange -- 
the potential interchange of the workers between the four Lakes 
definitely justifies the creation of a special wage schedule in 
this case. 

Did you want to bring up your request for -- 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a 

motion that the length of time for a minority report be extended 
beyond 7 days to the next meeting, the 15th of January. 

 

32 

MR. PEDERSEN: I second that motion. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. It's been moved and seconded 
to extend the length of time we’ll allow for a minority report 
until the January meeting of FPRAC. Any discussion? 

MS. ARCHER: And that would be 14 days instead of 7, 

just so I'm clear? This is working days? 

MR. DAVEY: It's more than 14 working days. 

MS. ARCHER: No. I think it is 14 or 15 working days. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: You mean additional beyond the 7. 

Is that what you're -- 

MS. ARCHER: No, no. It changes if there's 7 to 14. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Oh. 

MS. ARCHER: I just want to make sure that I have 

counted correctly to understand what you're asking for. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: You're basically saying the reason 
for this is the holidays and the -- is this so we recognize the 
special -- somewhat special case -- 

MR. DAVEY: Yes. 

MR. ALLEN: It looks like a total of 17 working days 

instead of -- 

MS. ARCHER: Well, the 2nd was granted off, right? 

 

order? 

MR. ALLEN: No, we never have that day off. 

MS. ARCHER: Well, I thought -- what was the executive 

33 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: It was the day after Christmas. 

MR. ALLEN: On my calendar, it's 17 total working days. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So it's 10 additional. 

MR. ALLEN: Yeah. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any further discussion? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Are we ready to vote? 

Or is there a consensus to adopt this motion? 

[No audible response.] 

MS. ARCHER: Jacque, do you have anything to weigh in 

on the consensus issue? 

MS. SIMON (via phone): I can barely hear. I don't know 

what the question is. 

MS. ARCHER: The question is, is there consensus on the 

motion to allow the minority report to be granted an extra 10 
working days to be completed? 

MS. SIMON (via phone): Okay. 

 

34 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So does Labor -- is there consensus 

to adopt this motion? 

MS. SIMON (via phone): I have no objection to that. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: We're good. 

MS. ARCHER: So, yeah, we have consensus. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So there is consensus then to allow 

an additional 10 working days beyond the 7, until the January 
meeting. Okay. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And that brings up item (f) under 

Old Business. Is there any discussion of the North Dakota issue? 
We did circulate Brenda Robert's letter regarding one request 
that OPM had received on that matter. I believe there is another 
pending request from DoD related to North Dakota and FWS. 

Is there something else you want to report on about 

this, Mark? 

MR. ALLEN: I don't have anything new to report on, 

other than what you've said, Mr. Chairman, other than that OPM 
did respond pretty quickly to the lead agency request to 
establish special wage rates for certain non-appropriated fund 
positions at Minot Air Force Base. Those were approved. 

 

35 

We are also looking into lead agency request to 

establish certain appropriated fund occupations as primary wage 
grade, wage leader, wage supervisor positions. 

MS. ARCHER: Can you clarify that there has been a 

request for the -- 

MR. ALLEN: Yeah. 

MS. ARCHER: Okay. 

MR. ALLEN: A request has been sent to OPM. 

MS. ARCHER: So there's one that's been approved and 

one that's pending? 

MR. ALLEN: That's right. 

MS. ARCHER: Okay. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any other discussion on the North 

Dakota issue at this time? 

MS. ARCHER: We look forward to hearing an update on 

the other request when it comes in. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. I'm sure we'll be able to 

provide something to the Committee about that as soon as we have 
that information. 

Okay. Then Item (g), any discussion on item (g) under 

Old Business? 

 

36 

MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chairman. OPM staff are currently 

developing, as we mentioned at our last meeting, an analysis of 
the wage area definition criteria for this proposal. We don't 
have anything today, but we will get something to the Committee 
as soon as we can. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So we'll have an OPM staff analysis 

of this issue possibly at the next meeting? 

MR. ALLEN: Soon. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Fairly soon? 

MR. ALLEN: As soon as we can. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: 10 working days? 

MR. ALLEN: An additional 17, maybe. 

[Laughter.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. So I guess we can move 

on to New Business, and the first item under New Business is 
changes we've been working on to the rules for our Committee. 

I did notice a couple other things. So we have 

suggested a couple more changes to what was sent to us from the 
working group. I'll just tell you quickly what those are. 

For several years now, we have been posting the 

transcripts of our meetings as well as the annual summaries of 
our work on the OPM website. We referenced that with respect to 

 

37 

transcripts in the revised new rules, but we didn't reference it 
with respect to the annual summaries, and we just corrected that 
to make it consistent and up to date. 

And the other change -- where is that? Okay. Let me 

find my copy. Madeline? 

MS. GONZALEZ: Page 4, V(e). 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Thank you. 

MR. FENAUGHTY: It's in red. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: It's in red, yeah. 

And then the other change, I found it a little bit 

confusing, the discussion about what is public and what is not 
from our documents and have tried to clarify that, and it's 
referenced in two places under reports in VI(a) and then at the 
end at VI(c), right after transcripts. And basically, the 
distinction is between documents that are introduced at a public 
meeting, which are publicly available upon request -- versus 
documents that are background to those documents or background 
analyses that are not actually introduced. And those would not 
be publicly available. 

Did I get that right, Mark? 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. 

 

38 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Those are the only two 

changes from what you had seen previously, but I have to stop 
reading this because every time I read it, I find something 
else. 

Anyway, so are we prepared to adopt our revised rules 

today? Any discussion of the rules? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Do we need a motion? We need a 

motion to adopt. 

MS. SIMON (via phone): Sheldon, this is Jacque. I'd 

like some time, actually, to think about that. One of the things 
that's always surprised me is the number of people who read all 
the transcripts and look through all the materials on FPRAC. I 
hear from them regularly, and so any reduction and availability 
of that would probably negatively affect our members. 

So if I could have some more time to consider this 

proposal, I'd appreciate it. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yeah. No, the intention certainly 

was not to reduce the public availability of anything.  

MS. SIMON (via phone): Okay. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there agreement then to postpone 

consideration of this? 

 

39 

MR. ALLEN: Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. We will take it up again 
in January. Hopefully, we can adopt it in January. That would be 
nice. 

And then -- 

MR. DAVEY: Mr. Chairman, I have just one comment. When 

I was reading through it, I noticed that there was a 7-day 
minority report time limit. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yes. 

MR. DAVEY: So that is why that was on top of my head. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Yes. That's what we -- yes, it is 

in here, and it was before. It's not a new thing. 

MR. DAVEY: Correct. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: It's been there.  

MS. ARCHER: Right, right. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So under New Business item (b), 

this is simply an informational table that I asked Madeline to 
put together which reviews all the various pay flexibilities 
available to Federal Wage System employees, potentially 
available, and it's not really anything for us to take action 
on. This is for everybody's background information. 

 

40 

But if there are any questions about it, feel free to 

ask them, any discussion or comment on it. 

MR. ALLEN: Mr. Chairman, I should point out that this 

is a compensation flexibilities document that was written 
specifically for Federal Wage System employees. There are some 
things in here that apply only to Federal Wage System employees, 
or they're slightly different than would apply to General 
Schedule employees. Like the unrestricted rates, that's not 
something that would apply under the General Schedule. 

Otherwise, things like recruitment, relocation, and 

retention incentives, those are under the same regulations. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any questions or discussion or 

comments on this? 

I found it a very useful document. I want to thank 
Madeline for putting it together. It was educational for me. 

MR. DAVEY: And looking at the top of page 2 where it 
talks about special schedules, we just took a vote on a special 
schedule, I think, and I was looking at this, comparing it to 
that. I don't see that FPRAC is authorized to vote a special 
wage schedule. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: What does it say? 

 

41 

MR. DAVEY: Lead agency with the approval of OPM may 

establish a --  

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there some statutory language 

that underlies that? 

Anybody here can answer that? What does it say? 

MR. ALLEN: I think it's probably best to cover that 

issue in the minority report, the one we already voted on. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Any other questions, 

comments, discussion about the 600-OC-3? 

MS. ARCHER: I just want to echo what you just 

suggested. I think this is a very helpful document, and thank 
you for putting to together. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Madeline. Thank Madeline. 

MS. ARCHER: Yeah. Madeline, thank you. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If there's no other New Business -- 

is there any other New Business? 

MR. ALLEN: I'd like to wish everybody Happy Holidays. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I second that motion. 

[Laughter.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Probably even get a consensus on 

that. That would be great. Okay. 

 

42 

MR. ALLEN: And extended into the new year as well. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And before we adjourn, please don't 

run out without tasting some of our delicious holiday party 
treats. If there's no objection, we could adjourn. 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing none, we are adjourned, and 
we will see everyone in the new year, and the happiest holidays 
to everyone.
