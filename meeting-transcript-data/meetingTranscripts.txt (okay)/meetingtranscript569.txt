Well, I think we'll have a fairly short meeting today, 
because we don't want to delay our holiday party too much, and we 
also have a working group meeting after that.

last meeting in October, and are there any changes to those 
minutes beyond those that we've already heard about from people? 
 
 
adopt those minutes? 
 
 
Good.  Minutes are adopted. 
 

MR. ALLEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  There seems to be a consensus.  

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, is there a consensus to 

One announcement: the meeting dates for 2012 have been

There was discussion back and forth at a couple of our 

MR. ALLEN:  Mr. Chairman, the original management 

might be a discussion today of Item (e) that we've been carrying 
around for a while, abolishment of Montgomery, Pennsylvania, 
nonappropriated fund wage area, 564-MGT-3. 
 
prior meetings, and some Labor folks made a counter-proposal.  
Management folks were going to study the issue and report back to 
the committee.  So the floor is open. I’m hoping we'll get a bit 
closer towards a quorum any minute, but let's go ahead and start 
talking about the issue at least. 
 
proposal under 564-MGT-3 recommended abolishing the Montgomery, 
Pennsylvania, nonappropriated fund wage area, and redefining some 
of its constituent counties to other nonappropriated fund wage 
areas. 
 
What 564-MGT-3 recommended was that Montgomery and 
Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania, be redefined as areas of 
application to the Burlington, New Jersey, wage area; that 
Chester County, Pennsylvania, be redefined to the Harford, 
Maryland, NAF wage area; that Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, be 
redefined to the Morris, New Jersey, nonappropriated fund wage 
area; and that Bucks County, New Jersey, be removed from the wage 
area definition because there are no longer any employees there.

After hearing from Labor members in regard to Chester 

 
County, which is represented by NAGE, the Management members 
would like to modify our recommendation that was in 564-MGT-3, in 
the degree that we recommend now that Chester County, 
Pennsylvania, be redefined as an area of application to the 
Burlington, New Jersey, wage area. 
 
The reason we think that is the appropriate thing to do 
is not strictly based on the primary regulatory criterion we look 
at, which is distance.  If we looked at it in terms of distance 
alone, then Harford would be the appropriate wage area for it to 
be defined to, but when we consider that Chester County is part 
of the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan Area, then we believe 
it's more appropriate to define it to the Burlington, New Jersey, 
wage area.

MS. SIMON:  Jacque Simon, AFGE. 
 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Just to bring you quickly up to 
date, we adopted the minutes from our last meeting, and we are 
now talking about item (e) under Old Business, abolishment of 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Why don't I stop there and have our 

MR. COX:  J. David Cox with the American Federation of

Is there any discussion of Mark's latest proposal? 
MS. SUSZCZYK:  I was trying to find the charts in my 

Montgomery, Pennsylvania, as a nonappropriated fund wage area, 
and Mark has just presented a modification to the original 
Management proposal as follow-up to a discussion we had a few 
meetings back about that and Labor's counter-proposal at that 
time. 
 
 
materials, but I don't seem to have them. 
 
The employees that would be considered under the 
Burlington area from Chester County, they'd be positively 
impacted by the change?  I know that considering them under 
Harford would have resulted in a pay decrease. 
 
 
 
about this one? 
 
 
 
the New Jersey -- 
 
 

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, they would. 
MS. SUSZCZYK:  Okay. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any other discussion or questions 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Is there consensus to -- 
MS. SIMON:  So it looks like they're going to go into 

MR. ALLEN:  Burlington. 
MS. SUSZCZYK:  Burlington. 

MR. ALLEN:  No.  Luzerne County, I believe that's where 

MS. SIMON:  Okay. 
MR. ALLEN:  -- would move to the Morris, New Jersey, 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If you guys need a map, you're

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  The change from the original 

MS. SIMON:  So all the counties that are moving are 

 
proposal is that Chester County, Pennsylvania, would be moved to 
the Burlington nonappropriated fund wage area. 
 
moving to the same place; is that correct? 
 
Wilkes-Barre is -- 
 
 
NAF wage area. 
 
welcome to share mine if you want to.  Here's a map if anybody 
wants it.

proposal from Management? 

MS. SUSZCZYK:  Thank you. 
[Off the record for Labor Members caucus.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  We are back in session. 
Any response from the Labor side to the revised 

MS. SIMON:  Okay.  I am remembering now. 
MS. SUSZCZYK:  Could we take a caucus for a minute? 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Certainly.  We have the Small

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Are there any New Business items 

MR. COX:  I would like to go back and ask sort of where 

MR. COX:  I think we're in agreement. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  So there's consensus on 564-

 
 
MGT-3, as revised.  Cool!  We adopted it.  Okay, very good. 
 
I don't think any of the other Old Business items need 
attention this morning, but if others have a different view, let 
me know.  Going once, twice, three times. 
 
 
this morning? 
 
we're at with AFGE's proposal, you know, consolidating and not 
crossing over.  We're fixing the second year of the pay freeze, 
but that pay freeze should come off in 2013, and so where are we 
with getting all of our ducks in a row, so that that can occur 
and happen? 
 
that's working on it.  The Director had asked that the working 
group have its report back to FPRAC by the end of this year and 
is eager to hear what FPRAC then has to recommend to him. 
 
I have been hearing from folks on the Management side 
that are doing the work that they feel they need more time than 
December 31st.  I think in the working group meeting that we're 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, we have a working group 

 

10 

MS. SIMON:  Would it be possible -- I mean, I -- I 

going to have right after this FPRAC meeting, one of the 
important items we have to talk about is precisely the timeline 
for wrapping this up.  I don't know if -- 
 
don't know, you know, how much more time, but would it be 
possible for the staff to submit to the Director what they have 
so far, with an acknowledgement that further work could be done 
in terms of filling out detail? 
 
But from our work group meeting, I think certainly all 
the conceptual work has been completed, and I don't think there's 
any good reason to draw this out.  The Director asked for 
something at the end of the calendar year.  I think we should 
provide him with something, and even if it's not finished to the 
last detail and the last four-place decimal number, a broad 
outline and plenty of detail has been provided and plenty of -- 
and like I said, as far as I understand, all the important 
decisions have been made about how the -- what the whole thing 
might look like, once implemented. 
And that's, I think, from my understanding of what the 
 
Director asked for, that was really what he was asking for, what 
would the map look like, how much will it cost, who will be 
where, and, you know, if there are some small detail questions 

 

11 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Anybody over here have any comment 

The working group is tasked with reporting to FPRAC, 

[No audible response.] 
MR. ALLEN:  At this point, the working group has 

that aren't completely, fully answered, that can occur later.  
But I feel as though something should be given to the Director by 
the end of the calendar year, as he requested. 
 
on this? 
 
 
completed a lot of the work that needs to be done to answer the 
questions that Director Berry had posed to the Committee. 
 
not with reporting to Director Berry.  So I think after the 
working group meeting today, we can determine from the working 
group, in which Sheldon is the Chairman, the next step about how 
the working group wants to communicate back to FPRAC, and then it 
would be up to FPRAC to make a recommendation to the Director. 
 
Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, a working 
group cannot make a recommendation to -- 
 
MS. SIMON:  Sure, I understand, Mark.  I just -- I feel 
like at least some of the delay has been, you know, tied to data 
requests from DoD, and DoD has its own schedule and its own set 
of responsibilities and has been able to provide some data, but 
maybe not as much data as the people putting together the report 

 

12 

And I don't know that the model needs all of it, all of 

Anything else on this issue? 

would have liked to in order to fully elaborate their model. 
 
the data.  I don't know that the model needs to be fully 
elaborate before it gets submitted to either FPRAC or Director 
Berry, given -- given the, you know, time constraints that DoD 
faced, because I know that we heard that repeatedly, like, "Of 
course, we'll get you that data, but we have these five things 
scheduled in the interim and won't be able to get them to you 
until" -- whenever, which is all perfectly legitimate.  It's just 
that that shouldn't delay getting a product to FPRAC or the 
Director. 
 
 
 
theme in the working group. 
 
the deadlines that the Director has asked us to meet, and we 
ought to have a clear idea of when we are going to wrap this 
thing up and also do it in a way that will be timely, but I don't 
know what more we can do sitting in here about that.  But we will 
take this up in the working group. 
 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any other discussion on this? 
[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Obviously, we will revisit this 

I have to say personally it does concern me if we miss

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Is there other New Business? 
[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, a motion to adjourn, so we 

 
 
 
 
can have our party, would be in order. 
 
 
 
 
 
we are adjourned, and Happy Holidays to everyone. 
 

[Laughter.] 
MR. COX:  So moved. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay. 
MR. ALLEN:  And second. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  And hearing no objections,
