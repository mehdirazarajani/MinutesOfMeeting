CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 610th 

meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee. My name is Sheldon Friedman, 

Chair of the Committee. As we always do, let’s go around the room and introduce ourselves. 

And we do have a couple of our members on the phone today. Let’s start with you today, Randy. 

MR. ERWIN: Randy Erwin with the National Federation of Federal Employees 

and the Metal Trades Department. 

MS. ARCHER: Candace Archer, AFGE. 

MR. SHORE: Robert Shore, National Association of Government Employees. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And, Jacque, can you introduce yourself please? 

MS. SIMON: [via phone] Jacque Simon, American Federation of Government 

Employees. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And Steve is out sick today, unfortunately. So, Mark? 

MR. ALLEN: Mark Allen with OPM. 

MR. LYNCH: Christopher Lynch, Department of Defense. 

MR. CURLEY: Dave Curley, Air Force. 

MR. BUCK: Gary Buck, Army. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And, Arleen, are you there? 

 MS. ROMBA: [via phone] Yes. This is Arlene Romba from the VA. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Thank you. Good morning. 

I should say at the outset, you may have noticed we have yet again new recording 

equipment. We have no idea how well it is going to work. It's an experiment, but I have been 

advised to please ask everybody to speak up, so you've been advised to speak up. And with that, 

I will ask the people around the edge of the room to please speak up and introduce themselves as 

 

4 

well. 

MS. ROBERTS: Brenda Roberts, Designated Federal Officer, OPM. 

MR. BRADY: Jim Brady, Department of Defense. 

MR. BECHT: Bill Becht, DoD. 

MS. KURIAN: Karen Kurian, DoD. 

MS. ABIERA: Erica Abiera, Department of Defense. 

MR. EICHER: Mike Eicher, OPM. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Madeline Gonzalez with OPM. 

MS. PAUNOIU: Ana Paunoiu, OPM. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Just one quick announcement. We have 

transmitted the majority recommendation to the Director, including the Chair’s rationale for 

supporting it, as well as the minority report, on the issue of Monroe County, Pennsylvania, so we 

think it's in the Director's hands now. 

Are there any other announcements that people have? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing none, let's move on to the review of the 

minutes of our last meeting. Does anyone have any corrections or changes beyond those we have 

already heard from you about? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, is there any objection to adopting the transcript 

of our last meeting? 

[No audible response.]

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing no objection, the transcript is adopted. 

Thank you. 

I would suggest we skip over Old Business for a minute and go down to New 

Business, which is our 2015 Annual Summary as a Committee. Everybody should have that. You 

have had it for a week or so and hopefully have had a chance to review it. Is there any 

discussion? We need to try to adopt this Annual Summary today. 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any questions? Discussion? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Is there any objection to adopting the Annual 

Summary? 

MR. ALLEN: No objection 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Do we have consensus on both sides to adopt the 

Annual Summary? 

MR. ERWIN: No objection. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Excellent. So, with that, we have adopted our Annual 

Summary for 2015. It will be posted on our website once we get the final version ready. 

We do have three Old Business items that have been in our Inbox for quite some 

time. I did ask at the last meeting if people would please take a look at those and see if there's 

any that we can move ahead. Are there any that people are ready to address today? 

I suppose we could ask Mark to summarize them for us, to refresh our memories 

about them. We can do that. 

MR. ERWIN: Mark is prepared, yeah.

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Mark is prepared. 

MR. ALLEN: I've got some stuff in my folder here. 

Basically, I would just mention that the Lee County, Virginia, proposal 

recommends no changes to the Eastern Tennessee wage area, where Lee County is defined to. 

That one has been on the agenda for—I don't know—probably four years now. We didn't have 

consensus on the Lee County issue. 

The South Bend-Mishawaka, IN-MI MSA proposal reviews the South Bend-

Mishawaka metropolitan area. It would have resulted in moving one county from one wage area 

to another with lower rates of pay, so we didn't have consensus on that one. 

For Green County, I would say this is one we may be able to move forward 

because there's actually no proposal before the Committee on this. We were asked to take a look 

at the geographic definition of Green County, Missouri, and we introduced FPRAC document 

607-OPM-3, at the end of August 2015. 

Apparently, there were some employees in Green County who were interested in 

seeing why their county is defined the way it is. Basically, what it boils down to is that Green 

County is part of the survey area for the Southern Missouri wage area, and we did an analysis of 

the regulatory criteria. Since it is a survey area county for the Southern Missouri wage area, it 

points to the county as being more similar to the Southern Missouri wage area. So, although we 

didn't say it in the document because it isn't a Management document—just an OPM study 

document—we don't see any reason to make any changes in the Southern Missouri wage area. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So, on the Labor side, are you folks ready to move on 

any of these or to put them to a vote, or do you need more time to study them? 

MR. SHORE: Mark, what other counties are in the Southern Missouri wage area?

MR. ALLEN: We don't have a listing of them in the package, but there's the map 

which shows all of the Southern Missouri wage area. 

MR. SHORE: Okay. 

MR. ALLEN: And the host installation is—is it Fort Leonard Wood? 

MR. BUCK: Fort Leonard Wood is right. 

MR. ALLEN: Fort Leonard Wood, yes. That's the main reason for that wage area 

to exist, but there are some other Federal Wage System employees there. 

Green County is basically synonymous with Springfield, Missouri. 

MR. SHORE: May I ask that we defer till next meeting to make a decision on 

that? 

discuss them? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Absolutely. 

Well, what about the others? Do we also defer those, or is anybody ready to 

MR. SHORE: We are okay to defer on those others. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. Well, unless there's some other New 

Business—let me ask: Is there any other New Business? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, it would be in order for us to adjourn. Is there 

any objection to adjourning? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing no objection, we are adjourned. See you all 

next month.
