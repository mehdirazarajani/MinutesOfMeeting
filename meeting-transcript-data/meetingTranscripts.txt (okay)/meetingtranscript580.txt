MR. MIKOWICZ:  Jerry Mikowicz, OPM, Designated Federal 

The only announcement I have is the letter that 

MR. EICHER:  Mike Eicher, OPM. 
MS. GONZALEZ:  Madeline Gonzalez, OPM. 
MS. MANCHESTER:  Brittney Manchester, OPM. 
MS. AVONDET:  Terri Avondet, OPM. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you. 
Unfortunately, we won't have a quorum on the 

 
 
Officer for this meeting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management side today, so we can discuss things and take straw 
polls, I guess, but we can't actually act on things that require 
votes at this point. 
 
Representative Runyan of New Jersey sent to President Obama 
regarding the pay disparity situation at the Joint Base McGuire- 
-Dix- Lakehurst in New Jersey. You have that letter in your 
packets. 
 
about that one? 
 
MR. LANDIS:  I'd just like to say that we appreciate, 
you know, being that's my home area, Congressman Runyan, all the 
work he's done to support the members there at the Joint Base 

Any other announcements people have, or questions

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Jerry, is there any update you 

MR. MIKOWICZ:  I'm really sorry to say that it's the 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay, thank you, Steve. 
MR. FENAUGHTY:  I kind of have a question, Sheldon. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Certainly. 
MR. FENAUGHTY:  So where are we at with this thing?  

McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. 
 
 
 
 
It seems like it's been going on forever. 
 
would care to provide the Committee? 
 
same message I've been repeating, the regulatory package is with 
the Director's office for a decision. Occasionally I receive and 
answer questions on it, but I don't see an answer or direction 
about the next step, so it is still with the Director’s office. 
 
answer, I guess, right? 
 
 
tracking system, and we review our trackings weekly, monthly, 
and that's where it is - in the Director’s office pending a 
decision. 
 
else before we move on? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Anything else on that or anything 

MR. FENAUGHTY:  So kind of in limbo would be the 

MR. ALLEN:  I'd say it's still pending a decision. 
MR. MIKOWICZ:  Yeah.  It's a live package in a

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Next step is the review of the 

Unless there's something that people want to discuss 

    Old Business.  Most of these items we have under 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing none, I assume we adopt 

 
 
transcript of our last meeting.  Are there any changes or edits 
that people want to suggest beyond those we've already heard 
about? 
 
 
the transcript.  Hearing no objection, the transcript is 
adopted. 
 
review in our working group.  Item (j) is actually something 
we'll be discussing today. 
 
in here right now on items (a) through (h) under Old Business, I 
suggest we just defer that to our next working group meeting, 
which will be in December. 
[No audible response.] 
 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Then that brings up New 
Business, and the first item is the Alternate Analysis of the 
Portland, Maine, FWS wage area, 580-MGT-1, which you have in 
your packets, and this was prepared pursuant to a request from 
folks on the Labor side for an alternative analysis of what

Mark, would you like to summarize this additional 

MR. ALLEN:  Sure. 
Yes, as the Chairman has mentioned, the Management 

should be done with the Portland, Maine, wage area. 
 
piece for people? 
 
 
side presented a review of the Augusta and Portland, Maine, wage 
areas, 578-MGT-1, in which we proposed abolishing the Portland 
wage area and moving it in its entirety to the Augusta wage 
area. 
The Management members conducted this analysis based 
 
on the idea that the Portsmouth wage area was being abolished 
and combined with Boston under the pending FPRAC recommendation 
that was initially made back in October 2010. 
After introducing this proposal at FPRAC, the Labor 
 
members requested that we do an additional analysis packet to 
analyze what would happen if the Portsmouth wage area was a 
continuing wage area.  We took a look at the regulatory criteria 
in 580-MGT-1, and it led to a different conclusion. 
 
the bottom of the first page -- we would recommend under this 
analysis that the Portland wage area be split into two parts, 
counties in the southern part, which are part of the Portland-

Based on the regulatory criteria analysis –-listed at

The primary determining factor for this conclusion 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any questions or discussion? 
[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Since we can't actually make a 

South Portland-Biddeford, ME, MSA, would go to the Portsmouth, 
New Hampshire, wage area and the counties that are in the 
northern part of Portland would go to the Augusta, Maine, wage 
area. 
 
would be distance as well as the fact that we currently have an 
MSA that is split between the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, wage 
area and the Portland, Maine, wage area.  We solve that problem 
if we adopt the analysis that we've done in 580-MGT-1. 
 
 
 
decision today, we could just defer this to the next meeting.  
Is that what people want to do? 
 
is just getting the alternative analysis out on the table, so 
everybody can take a look at it and become comfortable with the 
ideas that are in it, because they are different from what was 
initially proposed in 578-MGT-1. 
 
alternative analysis is that if we move Cumberland and Sagadahoc 
Counties to the Portsmouth wage area, they would become part of 

MR. ALLEN:  I think our main interest at this meeting 

One thing I neglected to mention under this

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  All right.  That brings up 580-

Mark, would you please summarize that one for us? 
MR. ALLEN:  Okay.  This is a fairly simple addition of 

MR. BERNHARDT:  So that would expand the survey area? 
MR. ALLEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  All right.  Last chance on this 

the survey area.  Androscoggin County would become part of the 
survey area for the Augusta wage area. 
 
 
 
one. 
 
 
MGT-2, definition of Vanderburgh County, Indiana, to a 
Nonappropriated Fund Wage Area. 
 
 
a county to an existing nonappropriated fund wage area.  It 
might seem a little strange, but we are talking about defining a 
county in Indiana to a Kentucky/Tennessee wage area.  That's the 
way the NAF areas work sometimes.  You have to skip across many 
counties to appropriately define a county based on distance to 
the nearest survey area, and that's what we do in this case. 
We received a request from DoD to define Vanderburgh 
 
County, Indiana.  There are currently two employees at the VA 
Evansville Outpatient Clinic in Vanderburgh County.  They're not 
currently defined to a wage area.  We took a look at the 

 

11 

We included an in-depth analysis at Attachment 1 that 

regulatory criteria through our standard analysis, and the only 
factor that points to defining the county to a wage area is 
distance.  The county is closest to the Christian/Montgomery 
nonappropriated fund wage area. 
 
the Department of Defense sent over to us with a couple of maps.  
On the second map, titled Proposed Regulations, you see 
Vanderburgh County came up in kind of a light shade of pink on 
the map.  It's a little hard to see, but it's one of the 
southernmost counties in Indiana, and it's being joined with the 
Christian, KY/Montgomery, TN, wage area. 
Looking further into the DOD analysis package, there 
 
are two employees at the VA outpatient clinic, both at grade NA-
2, and it's around 104 miles from Evansville, IN, to Fort 
Campbell, which is the host activity for the 
Christian/Montgomery wage area, and 123 miles to get to the next 
nearest wage area which is Hardin/Jefferson, Kentucky. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any questions or discussion? 
 
[No audible response.] 
 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If the Labor folks need a caucus, 
we can't actually render a final verdict on this today, but we 
could move the ball down the road by getting started on it. 

 

12 

MR. BERNHARDT:  We could take a brief caucus, Mr. 

We're going to have to consider this for a little bit 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Sure.  The wages were quite 

MR. BERNHARDT:  All right.  Mr. Chairman, we've got a 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay. 
[Labor Members went into caucus off the record.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We're back in session. 
The Labor folks have returned from their caucus, and 

 
Chairman. 
 
 
 
 
the floor is yours. 
 
lot to consider here in this package.  We're really concerned 
about this one, because we've got a mix or split in the factors 
as to which wage area is favored for putting Vanderburgh County 
into.  The distance factor favors the Christian/Montgomery wage 
area by just under 20 miles from the Hardin/Jefferson wage area, 
but the Hardin/Jefferson wage area is over a dollar an hour more 
than the Christian/Montgomery wage area.  And that's too 
significant to not set off all kinds of alarms. 
 
more time-- 
 
 
future meeting. 
 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Sure. 
MR. BERNHARDT:  -- and we want to tie this over to a 

 

13 

So we'll table that till our next meeting.  Is there 

appalling, I have to say for the record, at this location.  
Nothing wrong with the survey, I'm sure.  Just reflecting the 
appalling wages that exist in that sector of the economy. 
 
any other new business not already on our agenda? 
[No audible response.] 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  And if not, don't forget our not-
 
to-be-missed holiday party next month right after our meeting.  
Maybe that will draw better attendance on the Management side. 
 
blow-out. 
 
 
compliments all year on that. 
 
 
 
adjourned.  Thank you very much.  See you next month. 
 

Well, if there's no objection, we can adjourn. 
[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing no objection, we are 

MR. FENAUGHTY:  Well, especially after last year's

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yeah.  We've been hearing
