CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Good morning, everyone, and 

welcome to the 592nd meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate 

Advisory Committee.  My name is Sheldon Friedman, Chair of 

the Committee, and as we usually do, let's go around and 

introduce ourselves. 

 

 

Let's start with you today, Jacque. 

MS. SIMON:  Jacque Simon, American Federation of 

Government Employees. 

 

MR. GREGORY:  Adair Gregory, National Association 

of Government Employees. 

 

MR. LANDIS:  Steve Landis, Association of 

Civilian Technicians. 

 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Bill, are you on the phone? 

MR. FENAUGHTY:  Yes.  Bill Fenaughty, Metal 

Trades Department, with NFFE. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  And do we have anyone else on 

the phone? 

 

MS. BOYD:  Yes.  Stephanie Boyd from Veterans 

Affairs. 

 

MS. MONTGOMERY:  Carmen Montgomery from the 

Department of Veterans Affairs.

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you. 

Mark? 

MR. ALLEN:  Mark Allen with OPM. 

MR. SHULMAN:  Seth Shulman, Department of 

MS. SOKOL:  Pamela Sokol, Department of Army. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you, and good morning 

 

 

 

 

Defense. 

 

 

again.  If everyone else in the room could also introduce 

themselves. 

 

 

 

MS. GONZALEZ:  Madeline Gonzalez with OPM. 

MS. LYNCH:  Luis Lynch, Air Force. 

MS. ROBERTS:  Brenda Roberts, OPM, Designated 

Federal Officer. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. BUCK:  Gary Buck, Department of Army. 

MR. BRADY:  Jim Brady, DoD. 

MR. FENDT:  Karl Fendt, DoD. 

MS. CHAVES:  Becky Chaves, DoD. 

MR. EICHER:  Mike Eicher, OPM. 

MS. WALLACE:  Terri Wallace, OPM. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay, thank you. 

I’ll start off with a couple of announcements.  

You have in your packets a copy of the charter for the 

 

5 

Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee.  The charter 

has to be renewed every 2 years.  The only changes made to 

this new charter from 2 years ago is an update to item 7, 

which has a dollar figure for FPRAC's budget, and a couple 

of sentences were rearranged from paragraph 11 to paragraph 

12, so there were no substantial changes.  Charter renewal 

is something the General Services Administration requires 

of all statutory committees. 

 

The other item in your packet by way of 

announcement is the final version of what we approved at 

last month's meeting, which is our Annual Summary of 

Recommendations and Discussions for Calendar Year 2013, 

with a nice cover and everything.  It's very pretty. 

 

That brings up the transcript of our last 

meeting.  Are there any edits beyond those we have already 

heard about from you?  

 

 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  In that event, if there is no 

objection, we will adopt the transcript.  Any objection? 

 

 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing no objection, the 

transcript of our last meeting is adopted. 

 

6 

 

That brings up Old Business.  There were two 

items we talked about last month that we hoped we could 

move on with this month, the first of those being item (b) 

under Old Business, the special wage schedule pay practice 

for ACE lock and dam FWS employees. 

 

We have a report back from the Work Group on that 

item.  We wrestled with it for quite a while.  We 

recognized that the pay system isn't perfect, but the Work 

Group members could not find a way to improve upon it that 

wouldn't cost money that we suspect won't be forthcoming.  

So, therefore, the recommendation from the management side 

is simply to reaffirm the current pay practice for the lock 

and dam employees.  Is there any discussion? 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Is there consensus to do 

 

 

that? 

 

MS. SIMON:  I think I need to have my memory 

refreshed about the options that we looked at in the Work 

Group.  There were at least three alternatives that we 

considered. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  One option would be to move 

employees to the regular wage schedule of the wage area in 

 

7 

which their primary assignment is located.  That moves some 

people up and some people down in wages from where they are 

now. 

 

And I'm not sure what other option wouldn't -- 

was there some other option that we considered in the Work 

Group?  Anybody remember anything else we considered in the 

Work Group? 

 

 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I mean, it would be nice, I 

suppose, to pay the greater of the rates to people as they 

move around the lock and dam system.  I don't believe the 

Army Corps of Engineers would be interested in doing that. 

 

 

 

MR. SHULMAN:  No. 

MS. SIMON:  Okay. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  So we have consensus on this 

then to reaffirm the existing pay practice, and get that 

off our plate? 

 

 

MS. SIMON:  Yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay, thank you.  Then we’ve 

adopted 562-MGT-1, reaffirming the special pay practice for 

ACE lock and dam FWS employees. 

 

MR. ALLEN:  Mr. Chairman, in the Work Group, we 

 

8 

heard from the Army Corps of Engineers that they did not 

have recruitment and retention problems that could be 

solved by changing the pay practice, but this 

recommendation coming from FPRAC does not really preclude 

OPM from continuing to look at the pay issues of lock and 

dam employees.  If there appear to be problems in the 

future, we can take another look at this item. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  That would be, I 

think, useful to do, because one thing I do recall is there 

are, in some cases, very large disparities in pay in both 

directions for people in this system versus what they would 

be getting if they were just paid off the regular wage 

schedule for their wage area, based on the location of 

their primary duty station. 

 

The other topic we talked about trying to 

accomplish today is item (f) under Old Business, which is 

the need to do something about the Portland, Maine, wage 

area, which has fallen in employment and has lost its host 

activity, I believe.  However, after the last meeting, I 

was informed that OPM staff is working on an update of that 

analysis to reflect the latest commuting data and perhaps 

any changes in the definition of MSAs that might affect 

 

9 

Portland. 

 

I believe that update will be ready for our next 

meeting? 

 

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  It should be 

ready for the next meeting, hopefully. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay, so unless people feel 

an urgent need to begin the discussion on that one, we may 

as well wait for this additional document that we will 

receive next month.  Is that okay? 

 

MR. SHULMAN:  Yes.  It is better to have the 

total package. 

 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yes, all right. 

Any other item of Old Business that people would 

like to bring up this morning? 

 

 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  I don't have any New 

Business items today.  Does anyone else? 

 

 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  We have a Work Group 

meeting directly after this meeting to discuss the issue of 

FWS folks who make less than $10.10 per hour.  

 

If there is no objection, we can adjourn and 

 

10 

reconvene in about 10 minutes for our Work Group meeting. 

 

 

[No audible response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing no objection, we are 

adjourned.  Thank you very much.
