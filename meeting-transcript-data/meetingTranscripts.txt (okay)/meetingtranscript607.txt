P R O C E E D I N G  

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our 607th 

meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee. My name is Sheldon Friedman, 

Chair of the Committee, and as always, let’s please go around the room, and introduce ourselves. 

Let’s start with you today. Mark. 

MR. ALLEN: Mark Allen with OPM. 

MR. DAVEY: Jim Davey with DoD. 

MR. CURLEY: Dave Curley with the Air Force. 

MR. PEDERSEN: David Pedersen with Navy 

MS. ROMBA: Arleen Romba with VA. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Randy? 

MR. ERWIN: Randy Erwin with Metal Trades Department and NFFE. 

MS. ARCHER: Candace Archer, AFGE. 

MS. SIMON: Jacque Simon, AFGE. 

MR. SHORE: Robert Shore, NAGE. 

MR. ELLIOTT: Lamar Elliott, ACT. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Thank you. And if everyone else in the room could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

also please introduce themselves for the recorder. 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. HUNTER: Thurstan Hunter with VA. 

MS. JACOBSON: Jeanne Jacobson, OPM, Designated Federal Officer. 

MS. MERIWETHER: Rosemary Meriwether, Navy. 

MR. BRADY: Jim Brady, DoD. 

MS. DEIBLER: Katie Deibler, DoD.

MR. EICHER: Mike Eicher, OPM. 

MS. GONZALEZ: Madeline Gonzalez with OPM. 

MS. PAUNOIU: Ana Paunoiu, OPM. 

MR. MONLYN: Emell Monlyn, NAGE, Army. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Thank you, and welcome again, everyone. 

I want to start with an announcement about our friend and colleague Bill 

Fenaughty who we regretfully heard has retired. Well, good for him, I guess, not good for us. 

 

 

 

And, Jim, I think you wanted to say a few words about that. 

MR. BRADY: Thank you. Jim Brady, DoD. 

And I just want to take a moment to say how much I enjoyed working with Bill. I 

don’t know if all of you know, but Bill also served on the DoD Wage Committee as well as on 

FPRAC for years. He’s a great guy. I don’t want to claim to be his best friend or anything like 

that, but working with him as a professional colleague, I really will always remember the time 

that he and I have worked together. He has tremendous integrity, and I certainly enjoyed working 

with him. 

 

Those of you who will miss him like I do, please, if you know him, tell him we 

wish him well. I had the opportunity to talk to him by phone. Unfortunately, I missed his last 

Wage Committee, DoD Wage Committee meeting, and we had a thing scheduled for him, but he 

then missed what was to be his last meeting. 

 

So I just wanted to say good words about him, and I welcome the new member. 

I’m sure NFFE and Metal Trades Department will miss him, and what a great guy to work with!

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Jim. We will have to give him a 

transcript of this meeting, so he will see all the nice things we are saying. 

6 

 

MR. ERWIN: I would just like to say Bill is a great friend and mentor. At NFFE, 

we’re going to miss him very much, and I’ll absolutely pass along your kind words to Bill. 

Thank you. 

 

 

MR. BRADY: Thank you. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I also want to welcome Ana to her first FPRAC 

meeting. I guess it would be correct to say she is Terri’s replacement, Terri Wallace. Right, 

Madeline? 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. GONZALEZ: Yes, correct. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. 

MS. SIMON: What happened to Terri? Did she move on to another job, or what? 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Tell us what happened to Terri, Madeline or Mark. 

MR. ALLEN: Terri had her second child and elected to leave federal service, at 

least for the time being, and moved with her husband down to Charleston, South Carolina. 

 

long? 

 

 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: She had been here for quite a while?  Roughly how 

MR. ALLEN: Five years? 

MS. GONZALEZ: At least five, yes. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: A couple of quick announcements. Folks might be 

interested to see the one public comment that was received in response to the regulation on the 

four lakes in Mississippi, a proposal FPRAC dealt with, so you have that in your packet. 

 

I also want to thank the staff for preparing and circulating 607-OPM-1, which I 

had never seen before, and found quite interesting. It is the breakdown by employment of the 

rather large number of different prevailing rate pay plans.  

7 

 

 

 

 

I suppose I should ask if there are any questions about that. 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, if you think of something later on, bring it up. 

Why don’t we move on to review the transcript from our last meeting?  Are there 

any changes to the transcript that we haven’t heard from you about already? 

 

 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, is there any objection to adopting the transcript 

of our last meeting? 

 

 

 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing no objection, the transcript is adopted. 

That brings up Old Business. We heard from Steve Landis, who is unable to be 

here today, that he would like to have the New Jersey Joint Base issue put off in terms of 

discussion to the next meeting in October, at which time he wants to bring it up. It doesn’t mean 

we can’t talk about it today. I’m just passing on this message we got from him, and he will be 

back next month. 

 

Is there any Old Business item, (a) through (e), including the Joint Base, that 

people want to bring up this morning? 

 

 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, we can move on to New Business. We have a 

couple of items. 

 

The first item (a), Counties Redefined/Not Redefined or Split Due to 

Organizational Relationships, is an update of a document that was introduced a few meetings 

ago, 599-OPM-2. We had had a discussion about how FPRAC had dealt in the past with wage 

8 

areas that have closely related installations that straddle wage area boundaries. Documents 599-

OPM-2 and 607-OPM-2 are lists that OPM staff has put together of how FPRAC has tackled 

those issues in the past. So that’s what that is. Is there any question or discussion about that? 

 

 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, we can move on to (b) under New Business, 

Review of Greene County, Missouri, 607-OPM-3. It was prepared pursuant to a request from 

AFGE sometime back. 

 

 

Mark, would you please summarize that one for us? 

MR. ALLEN: Yes, Mr. Chairman. This is 607-OPM-3. At a request from a 

member of the Committee, OPM has conducted a review of Greene County, Missouri, to see 

where it currently lies in relationship to criteria for defining Federal Wage System wage areas. 

 

Greene County, if we look at the maps, which are in Attachment 1, the first map 

is for the Kansas City wage area, and the second map is for Southern Missouri. And on that 

second map, you will find that Greene County is currently a survey county, and it’s also part of 

the Springfield, MO Metropolitan Statistical Area. 

 

The host activity for the Southern Missouri wage area—and this is not all that 

unusual—is a military base that lies outside of the metropolitan area. It’s actually Fort Leonard 

Wood, which is in Pulaski County. But the survey area does encompass six counties in Southern 

Missouri. That’s why there’s a separate wage area there. There are federal activities also in the 

Springfield, MO MSA, but the main reason for the wage area to exist separately is because of 

Fort Leonard Wood. 

 

When we look at the regulatory criteria analysis for—well, let me back up a little 

bit. Greene County has also an Army installation there with around 115 employees. The 

9 

Department of Justice has a prison that’s in Springfield, MO, an area in Greene County, and 

there are around 50 FWS employees there. 

 

Now, because it is a survey county, it’s kind of going to lead us through our 

regulatory analysis to say that Greene County, since it’s part of the Springfield, MO, 

metropolitan area, is going to resemble the Southern Missouri survey area more than the Kansas 

City survey area. Kansas City is the other point of comparison we are using. 

 

In terms of distance, the regulatory criteria would favor leaving Greene County in 

the Southern Missouri wage area. The commuting patterns and other criteria are indeterminate. 

 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Any questions or discussion? 

MS. SIMON: Well, I just want to thank you for preparing this. I’d like some more 

time to study it and discuss it with our members in the wage area. 

 

 

 

 

 

MR. SHORE: Which county did you say Fort Leonard Wood was on? 

MS. SIMON: Pulaski. 

MR. ALLEN: Pulaski County. 

MR. SHORE: Okay. 

MR. ALLEN: So if there are 821 FWS employees in the Southern Missouri wage 

area and there are around 150, 160 just in Greene County, I think it’s still safe to say that even 

without Fort Leonard Wood, there would still be a separate Southern Missouri wage area. There 

are enough employees even if Fort Leonard Wood would not be there. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So it sounds like we’re hearing from the Labor folks 

that they would like to defer this to the next meeting? 

 

 

MS. SIMON: Yes, please. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. 

10 

 

I actually don’t see a clear statement in this one, Mark, about a Management 

recommendation. 

 

MR. ALLEN: No. What we’ve been doing with these OPM reviews lately is 

providing the Committee with information that the Committee requests. We haven’t presented a 

Management recommendation on this one. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So what action does the Committee ultimately need 

to take on this one then? 

 

MR. ALLEN: Since this is really just provided as information, the Committee 

doesn’t need to make any recommendation on the OPM study document unless a member feels 

there’s a need to make a motion for something. 

 

 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Well, we can revisit this next time. 

MS. SIMON: Yeah. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: And that brings up item (c) under New Business, 

Review of Newburgh, New York, Federal Wage System Wage Area, 607-MGT-1. 

 

 

Mark, please take us through this one also. 

MR. ALLEN: Okay. Under 607-MGT-1, we do actually have a recommendation 

to present to the Committee. 

 

We have undertaken a review of the Newburgh, New York, wage area, and 

identified that the two major employment counties in the Newburgh wage area are indeed now 

part of the New York-Newark-Jersey City metropolitan statistical area, and based on that, we 

don’t see that there is a compelling need to continue having the New York-Newark-Jersey City 

metropolitan area split between Newburgh and New York Federal Wage System wage areas. 

11 

 

And in this kind of proposal, what we have gone through is an analysis of the 

regulatory criteria after we reached the decision that the Newburgh wage area can be abolished. 

 

Based on the regulatory criteria, what we are recommending is that Orange 

County, NY, be redefined to the New York survey area; Dutchess County, NY, be redefined to 

the New York area of application; Delaware and Ulster Counties, NY, be redefined to the 

Albany-Schenectady-Troy area of application; and Sullivan County, NY, be defined to the 

Scranton-Wilkes-Barre area of application. 

 

All of these recommended changes are primarily based on the distance criterion, 

except for the two counties that would be added to the New York wage area. 

 

And when we look on page 3 of this document, you will find there are currently 2 

Federal Wage System employees in Delaware County, 39 in Dutchess County, around 800 in 

Orange County, none in Sullivan County, which would be going to the Scranton wage area, and 

12 employees in Ulster County, who would be going to the Albany wage area. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: I have a couple of questions on this one, but I’ll hold 

off for a minute and see if there are any questions or discussion from Labor’s side of the table. 

 

 

1? 

 

them. 

 

 

MS. SIMON: I think this looks like a reasonable proposal. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. Then is there a consensus to adopt 607-MGT-

MR. ALLEN: If you have questions, Mr. Chairman, I’m happy to try to answer 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Well, I think I will just hold off on them. 

MR. ERWIN: Could you just repeat how many employees were in the counties 

that are not going into the New York wage area? 

12 

 

MR. ALLEN: It would be 2 in Delaware County that would go to Albany, and 12 

in Ulster County that would be going to Albany as well. Those are all Department of the Army 

employees, but the ones in Ulster County are most likely National Guard since they’re 

represented by ACT. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MS. SIMON: Sullivan County doesn’t have any; is that correct? 

MR. ALLEN: That’s correct. There are no employees there. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: More questions or discussion? 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: So is there consensus to adopt this? 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Okay. If there is, we have adopted 607-MGT-1. 

MR. ALLEN: The next course of action would be for OPM to issue a proposed 

regulation on this, and then after receiving public comments, issue a final regulation, so it is 

probably going to take, at a minimum, 6 months to make the change effective, as it normally 

would. 

 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: All right. Is there any other New Business item that 

people want to bring up today? 

 

 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: If not, it would be in order for us to adjourn. Is there 

any objection to adjourning? 

 

 

[No response.] 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: Hearing none, we are adjourned.
