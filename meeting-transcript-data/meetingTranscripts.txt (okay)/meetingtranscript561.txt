CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Welcome, everybody, to this

the Chairman, and why don't we go around and introduce

MR. BRADY:  Jim Brady, DoD. 
 
MS. CHAVES:  Becky Chaves, DoD. 
 
MR. ROVAN:  Hank Rovan, DoD. 
 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Welcome, everyone.  We 
may be joined by a few other members, but we'll go ahead and 
get started. 
 
Senator Boozman raised for our Committee? 
 
MR. ALLEN:  We are making progress on the study of 
the special pay practice for lock and dam employees and hope 
to have something to the Committee fairly soon. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  That would be good. 
 
 
That brings up the review of the minutes of our 
last meeting.  Are there any further changes beyond those 
that people have already submitted?  I trust everyone has a 
copy. 
 
transcript that we will post on our website.  I think that's 
a good development. 
 
 
 
 

Any further changes? 
[No response.] 

Is there anything new to report on the issue that 

These will be our first minutes or actually

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, is there a motion that 

MR. PHELPS:  None. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  In that case, we have 

MR. PHELPS:  So moved. 
MR. ALLEN:  Second. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Is there any objection to 

 
we accept the transcript? 
 
 
 
accepting the transcript? 
 
 
accepted our minutes from our last meeting. 
 
County, it's been suggested this would be a good one to 
incorporate into our working group conversation, so I'm 
going to propose that we do that.  We will be having a 
working group meeting shortly after the conclusion of our 
FPRAC meeting this morning. 
 
have regarding the issues we ought to be discussing in that 
working group, I guess we can either have that conversation 
here or there or both places. 
We do have the memo of ideas that I circulated at 
 
our last meeting.  I'm happy to see it expanded, contracted, 
revised in any way people think it ought to be.  If there's  
 
 

We can move on to old business.  The review of Lee 

If there are any other suggestions that people

MR. PHELPS:  The only thing on that shown in 

nothing on that right now, why don't we also leave that for 
our working group conversation. 
 
there, in a lot of the areas covered there, which I think is 
a very good place for us to start, maybe one of the things 
we'll want to consider discussing along with that is maybe 
some more training for the labor participants with that 
since, in some places, evidently we're not having that, and 
I think that a lot of it might be due to they don't 
understand how it works. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I think that's an excellent 
 
suggestion, and in fact, I definitely want to address that 
issue. 
 
about the working group? 
[No response.] 
 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Not for now?  Okay. 
MR. ALLEN:  I guess we should just note for the 
 
record that we'll be meeting immediately after the FPRAC 
meeting today. 
 
 
 
 

Is it over in the Pendleton Room? 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yes, the small Pendleton Room. 

All right.  Anything else on the memo I circulated

Welcome, Jackie.  Why don't you introduce yourself 

MS. SIMON:  Jackie Simon, AFGE. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Go ahead and introduce 

MR. ERWIN:  Randy Erwin with NFFE. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Welcome, everyone. 
So that brings up our first item of new business, 

 
for the record here? 
 
 
yourself, too. 
 
 
 
the abolition of Cumberland, Maine, as a non-appropriated 
fund FWS wage area, and I believe everybody has the document 
561-MGT-1. 
 
 
employment levels within a non-appropriated fund wage area 
drop to a level where they're below the capability for 
conducting a global wage survey, and that's what's happened 
or happening as we speak in the Cumberland, Maine, 
non-appropriated fund wage area. 
 
employees in the wage area.  It will drop probably to 19 
with the closure of the base exchange in March, and Morale, 
Welfare, and Recreation employment will go away in May, but  
 
 

Would you please summarize the issue for us, Mark? 
MR. ALLEN:  Okay.  From time to time, the 

The last count that we have showed a total of 29 

 

  
 

 

7 

It's a fairly simple decision because what we're 

there will still be a handful of employees left in the 
Cumberland wage area. 
 
So what we're proposing with this is that we 
abolish the Cumberland wage area and combine any of the 
counties that would have continuing employment with the 
York, Maine, non-appropriated fund wage area. 
 
basically doing is taking all the counties north of York 
County, and redefining them to the York wage area.  There's 
a map a few pages back into the package which shows how the 
Cumberland wage area is currently defined, with Cumberland 
County as the survey area and several other counties as 
areas of application. 
 
Maine, wage area, which would just include Cumberland, 
Kennebec, and Penobscot Counties in addition to what's 
already there. 
 
this change made as soon as we can, so the remaining 
employees can be put on the York wage schedule.  As you can 
see on page 2, the redefinition would become effective on 
the first pay period beginning on or after July 25th, 2011,  
 
 

And then the third map is the proposed new York, 

Because of the survey timing, we'd like to get

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any questions or discussion? 
[No response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Have folks had a chance to 

MS. SIMON:  No.  I mean, I think it's okay. 
MR. PHELPS:  I would like to have a caucus. 
MS. SIMON:  Oh, you would like to have a caucus? 
MR. PHELPS:  Yes. 
MS. SIMON:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  I believe we have the 

the same date that the Cumberland wage schedule would have 
become effective. 
 
 
 
review this issue?  Do you need a caucus? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
small Pendleton Room; is that right?  So we will eagerly 
await your return. 
 
 
questions or discussion about 561-MGT-1? 
 
 
it? 
 
 
 
 

[Caucus held off the record.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Welcome back.  Are there any 

MS. SIMON:  No.  Everything is okay. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Is there consensus to adopt 

MS. SIMON:  Yes. 
MR. PHELPS:  Yes.

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  So we have done that one.  

MR. ALLEN:  With that being the case, we'll 

That brings up our other item of new business, 

MR. BATES:  My name is Ken Bates.  I work within 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Before we move on, we 

 
Okay.  It has been adopted. 
 
proceed as soon as we can to get an interim regulation out 
on this one, so that the remaining employees are transferred 
to the existing York, Maine, wage area. 
 
have a guest from another part of OPM.  I would like for him 
to introduce himself for the record. 
 
OPM.  I work in the Partnership and Labor Relations Division 
and also administrative support to another FACA committee.  
I wanted to see how this FACA committee works.  I work on 
the National Council of Federal Labor-Management Relations. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Welcome.  We're glad you could 
come today. 
 
Alaska set-aside area differential schedules, and I believe 
everyone has document 561-MGT-2. 
 
 
simple administrative matter.  The International Boundary  
 
 

Mark, why don't you summarize that for us, please? 
MR. ALLEN:  Okay.  This is actually a fairly 

 

  
 

 

10 

Commission is the agency that's responsible for 
administering the boundary between the United States and 
Canada.  As everybody is aware, that boundary can be quite 
remote, and in parts of Alaska, they have requirements to 
monitor border crossings.  They have a facility near Eagle, 
Alaska, that's in a very remote part of the State of Alaska. 
 
The practice for paying employees who are in 
remote parts of Alaska is to either pay a 4 percent, 8 
percent, or a 12 percent differential above the regular wage 
schedule, and this is part of the set-aside wage schedule 
practices that are documented in Appendix V of the OPM 
Operating Manual. 
 
requested that they be given permission to have their 
employees paid, if appropriate, under one of the 
differential schedules, and in Eagle, Alaska, that would 
obviously be the 12 percent differential schedule because it 
is in a very remote part of Alaska. 
 
There shouldn't actually be anybody there right 
now, but they do employ people on a temporary basis, and 
they're usually there in the summer under what are 
apparently pretty rugged living conditions. 
 
 

The International Boundary Commission has 

 

  
 

 

11 

So we think it's a good idea to extend this pay 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any questions or discussion on 

[No response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Is there consensus to adopt 

 
practice, even though it is one of the set-aside pay 
practices to the International Boundary Commission, and we 
have done this before.  It originated as a Department of 
Defense pay practice prior to the Federal Wage System, but 
we've also added the Department of the Interior and the 
General Services Administration over time.  This comes up 
about every 10 years or so, we need to add a new location. 
 
this one? 
 
 
this one? 
 
ATTENDEES:  Yes. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Very good.  So we've adopted 
561-MGT-2, and I believe that concludes our new business. 
 
At the last meeting, there was a question about 
telephone participation in the DoD wage survey committees. 
 
 
why can't we do this by telephone, we contacted Mr. Freeman 
who is the Deputy Advisory Committee Member, Assistant  
 
 

Would you fill us in, John, on that? 
MR. EHRBAR:  After Jackie's question last time, 

 

  
 

 

12 

Director, Administration of Program Support, Office of WHS, 
which means he's the guy in charge of FACA for us. 
 
We actually have now working within the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense a protocol which will allow us to 
do in-person FACA closed meetings.  The necessary protocols 
and procedures need to be developed and coordinated before 
implementation, but Freeman was optimistic that this could 
happen later in the year. 
 
In the meantime, the wage authority is looking at 
the options that we're going to have as we move CPMS to our 
new building in the fall and what will be available there, 
but however, for those instances, rare instances where a 
committee member can't attend the meeting in person now, we 
can do it telephonically, so we'll have to try to ease that 
up. 
 
What we hope to do is to be able to do it all 
electronically and still keep the closed nature of the 
meetings.  That's a plus.  Thanks for the suggestions. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Thank you for the 
information. 
 
before us? 
 
 

Is there any other business that needs to come

[No response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, is there a motion to 

MR. PHELPS:  So moved. 
MR. ALLEN:  And seconded. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  All right.  Any objection to 

 
 
adjourn? 
 
 
 
that? 
 
 
break, why don't we say 10 minutes, and convene in the small 
Pendleton Room for our working group. 

[No response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, we will take a short
