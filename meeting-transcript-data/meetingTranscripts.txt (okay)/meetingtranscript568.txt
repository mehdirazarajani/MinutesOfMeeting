room introduce themselves. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prevailing Rate Pay Adjustments memorandum that is in your 
packets, essentially detailing how the pay freeze impacts FWS 
folks.  Any questions or discussion about that?

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Thank you, Mark. 
Unless there's anything else on this item, our next 

This memorandum provides OPM guidance to lead agencies under the 
Federal Wage System.  It states that pay adjustments are still 
frozen during fiscal year 2012 and provides instructions on how 
agencies should implement the pay freeze during FY 2012. It also 
explains the requirement under the Prevailing Rate Systems Act 
for Federal Wage System wage schedules to continue to be released 
on their normal effective dates and that’s the main reason for 
getting this memorandum out. 
 
 
agenda item is review and hopefully adoption of the transcript of 
our previous meeting.  Has everyone had a chance to review the 
transcript from the last meeting? 
[No audible response.] 
 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Are there any other corrections or 
changes beyond those that people have already submitted to us? 
 
 
adopt the transcript from the last meeting? 
 
MR. FISHER:  I'll make the motion. 
MR. ALLEN:  And I'll second.

Moving on to a list of old business items, most of 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing no objection, it is 

 
adopting the transcript? 
 
 
adopted. 
 
these are in abeyance pending working group consideration.  Is 
there anything new today on Item (e)?  Any discussion of that, 
the abolishment of Montgomery, Pennsylvania, Nonappropriated Fund 
Wage Area? 
MR. ALLEN:  Mr. Chairman, the Management members are 
 
still investigating the background of how Nonappropriated Fund 
Wage Areas have been established and changed in the past, so 
there is nothing new on that yet. 
 
side on that one today? 
 
said. 
 
MR. ALLEN:  A couple of meetings ago, we said that we 
would look into the background of how decisions had previously 
been made for redefining Nonappropriated Fund Wage Areas, and the

through and figure how things were decided. 
 
you have some information for us. 
 
memorandum from Commander David Hanson, Department of the Air 
Force, which I believe everyone has.  Any questions about that, 
or discussion? 
It bears on the item that we are working on in our 
 
working group.  Sarah, did you want to say anything about it? 
MS. SUSZCZYK:  I know that Commander Hanson submitted 
 
it to FPRAC in August, and NAGE wanted to ensure that it was on 
the record.  I understand that we are still working on this issue 
in the working group, but we wanted to make sure that Commander 
Hanson's position was in the record.

 That means they like all those dates, right?

will convene in the Small Pendleton Room for those of us who are 
in the working group.
