CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Good morning, everyone.  Welcome 

MR. ALLEN:  Mark Allen with OPM. 
MR. SHULMAN:  Seth Shulman, Department of Defense. 
MS. VANKEUREN:  Tammy Vankeuren, Air Force. 
MR. WILLIAMS:  Lamar Williams, Department of the Navy. 
MR. LANDIS:  Steve Landis, ACT. 
MS. SIMON:  Jacque Simon, AFGE. 
MR. FENAUGHTY:  Bill Fenaughty, MTD, NAFE. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Sarah? 
MS. SUSZCZYK:  Sarah Suszczyk for NAGE. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  And folks around the sides of the 

 
to this, our 579th meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate 
Advisory Committee.  My name is Sheldon Friedman, Chair of the 
Committee, and as usual, why don't we introduce ourselves, 
starting today with you, Mark. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
room, if they also could introduce themselves, please? 
 
 
 
 
 

MR. FENDT:  Karl Fendt, DoD Wage. 
MS. ARROYO:  Melissa Arroyo, Navy. 
MR. BRADY:  Jim Brady, DoD. 
MR. ROVAN:  Hank Rovan, DoD. 
MR. MIKOWICZ:  Jerry Mikowicz, OPM.

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Thank you all. 
One announcement that is not actually on our agenda, I 

MR. EICHER:  Mike Eicher, OPM. 
MS. GONZALEZ:  Madeline Gonzalez, OPM. 
MS. AVONDET:  Terri Avondet, OPM. 
MR. SOMERS:  Nate Somers, Air Force legislative fellow 

 
 
 
 
assigned to OPM. 
 
 
think everybody knows by now we're about to have an earthquake 
drill at 10:18 a.m.  We have special dispensation to continue 
our meeting and stay here in this room.  Hopefully, there won't 
be too much commotion.  I have no idea what it's going to be 
like in terms of the noise level.  We'll just have to see. 
 
at this event, because we're likely to do more harm to 
ourselves, and we should just stay in our chairs. 
 
 
temporary quarters. 
 
article written by Representative Runyan in New Jersey in the 
online newspaper up there in Toms River concerning the issue of 
pay disparity at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  

MR. ALLEN:  I think we should not get under the table 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yeah, probably not.   
So I hope everyone likes our cozy, new, hopefully 

I have two other quick announcements.  I circulated an 

 

6 

 
I also circulated a letter I received from Mr. Dave 
Dauman, President of AFGE Local 3495, concerning complaints he 
had about the wage survey in the Madison, Wisconsin, wage area.  
I’ll be responding to him, so I'm asking for some help and input 
from all of you.  I did have a conversation with Jim Brady about 
it, and I will, of course, share my reply with everyone.  I 
would welcome any input people wish to have to that reply. 
 
That brings up the review of the minutes of our last 
meeting.  I would say from my standpoint, the transcript wasn't 
quite up to snuff, and I don't know if it was the use of the 
experimental recorder or what, but this is what we're going to 
have to be working with for the next few months.  Did anybody 
have any other corrections to the transcript from the last 
meeting? 
 
 
adopting the transcript from the last meeting? 
 
 
transcript is adopted. 
 
That brings up Old Business.  Let me start with the 
leftover item 577-MGT-1, Definition of Rochester, Minnesota, 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  If not, is there any objection to 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Hearing no objection, that 

 

7 

Mark, was there concurrence on that on from the absent 

MR. ALLEN:  Yes.  Yes, we have concurrence on that. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  So that has been adopted.  Thank 

MS. SIMON:  I was going to say we're dealing with them 

MSA. 
 
Management members? 
 
 
you. 
Is there anything on items (a) through (h) under Old 
 
Business that anyone would like to bring up this morning?  Most 
of those are in our work group. 
 
in the work group. 
 
 
(j). 
Nothing on (a) through (h)? 
 
[No audible response.] 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  So last time we began to 
 
take up the review of the Augustaand Portland, Maine, FWS wage 
areas, 578-MGT-1. Mark, you indicated that more analysis would 
be forthcoming pursuant to requests from the Labor side, county 
by county within the Portland wage area and byMSA to see what 
result application of the regulatory criteria would point to.  

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Most of them, yeah. 
If not, I'd like to revisit at least briefly (i) and 

 

8 

MR. ALLEN:  We don't have our further analysis 

What we've basically decided to do is provide 

Is there anything new to report on that this morning? 
 
developed to share with the committee this morning.  We should 
have it ready for the next meeting. 
 
supplemental information to 578-MGT-1.  In the document that's 
currently before the Committee, 578-MGT-1, we had not included 
an analysis of the Augusta and Portland, Maine, wage areas, by 
looking at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, wage area, because we 
had an FPRAC recommendation earlier this year that would result 
in combining the Portsmouth wage area with the Boston wage area.  
So what we are going to do is look at the Portland wage area and 
do the standard regulatory analysis for the Portland wage area.  
It is still a wage area that has to be abolished, and we are 
going to look at it in regards to the regulatory criteria also 
by doing an analysis of the criteria as if the Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire, wage area would continue to be a separate wage area. 
 
would be whether it goes to Augusta, Maine, and the other choice 
would be whether it goes to Portsmouth. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Mm-hmm.  So I guess unless there's 
any further question or discussion or comment on that one, we'll 

So there are only really two choices.  One choice

MR. BYRNE:  My name is Robbins Byrne.  I'm with the 

Is there anything further today on that one? 
[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  We'll defer it. 
We have a latecomer visitor coming in.  If you would 

just defer it until the next meeting. 
 
 
 
 
just announce yourself to the recorder. 
 
Pay Systems Group, OPM. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay, thank you. 
 
That brings up item (j) under Old Business, the 
 
application of the changes in the North American Industry 
Classification System (NAICS) to the surveyable industries in 
the Federal Wage System surveys, a challenging item.  I have 
enjoyed reading it.  I hope you all did too. 
 
possibly reach consensus around that one today?  Who would like 
to start? 
 
Mark, briefly? 
 
 
every few years.  We used to do this once a decade when we were 

Is there any discussion now about that one?  Can we 

Do you want to maybe start by reviewing that again, 

MR. ALLEN:  I'll give just a very brief summary. 
This is a standard practice that OPM goes through 

 

10 

When OMB switched over to the North American Industry 

using the Standard Industrial Classification manual for 
determining which industries would be included in Federal Wage 
System wage surveys. 
 
Classification System, they started doing updates more 
routinely.  It seems like they're on a 5-year plan for doing 
these. 
 
Basically, the position we've adopted over the years 
is to -- when an Industry Code changes, we want to, as best we 
can, maintain the status quo for the types of industries that 
are surveyed under Federal Wage System surveys.  This is 
basically a bookkeeping exercise to make sure that that policy 
is something that continues. 
So there aren't really a whole lot of changes in this 
 
that result in any big swings in companies that are included or 
excluded from surveys.  This is something we need to keep on top 
of, so that our regulations are consistent with NAICS manual 
codes. 
 
 
 
how -- I'm just curious how much -- it probably would be a 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Any discussion?  Any questions? 
[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  I did have a question.  I wonder 

 

11 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Right. 
MR. ALLEN:  And I'm not sure that they have that much 

pretty sizable project, but I'm just curious how much employment 
there is in these very small sub-industries where they've been 
reclassified or redefined relative to the total in the larger 
NAICS code, of which they're a part.  This might help people see 
this is a really small set of changes, which I assume it is. 
 
MR. ALLEN:  This type of information would have to 
come from the technical staff from DoD.  They may or may not 
have a database available that would provide that type of 
information, but it would be on a nationwide basis. 
 
 
information to tailor the surveys for a survey area.  So we'd 
have to look at 132 appropriated fund wage areas and 120-some 
NAF wage areas to do that analysis. 
 
to do that. 
 
 
appreciate it if I pony it up, pony [inaudible]. 
 
discussion, any questions on the Labor side about this? 
 

So you're correct, Mr. Chairman.  It's a lot of work 

[Laughter.] 
MR. SHULMAN:  Yes.  And I don't think that they'll 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, then is there any 

[No audible response.] 

 

12 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  So can -- 
MS. SIMON:  Can -- 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Go ahead. 
MS. SIMON:  No.  Finish, because I'm going to bring up 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Is there consensus to adopt these 

MS. SIMON:  Sure. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  So we have adopted 578-MGT-

 
 
 
 
a new thing. 
 
numerous small changes to definitions of the surveyable 
industries? 
 
 
2.  Thank you. 
Well -- 
 
 
MS. SIMON:  I know you asked before, and I didn't say 
anything, but I can't recall item (c) on the list being on our 
agenda for the workgroup. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discussed it yet. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  It's there. 
MS. SIMON:  It is? 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yeah. 
MS. SIMON:  We just haven't gotten to it? 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yeah. 
MS. SIMON:  Okay.  I just can't remember having 

 

13 

MS. SIMON:  I get a monthly phone call on this, on 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Well, we can discuss it in 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We have it in there,  
MS. SIMON:  Okay. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We kicked it to the Work Group. 
MS. SIMON:  Okay. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  That doesn't mean we can't discuss 

 
 
 
 
 
it in here. 
 
that subject. 
 
here now if you want, or we canbring it up in the work group, 
whatever you prefer. 
 
group. 
 
it, Seth? 
 
specific issue is unique to the Army Corps of Engineers, 
essentially, I would request that we have a discussion when we 
can have someone from Army in the room, even if they're not 
sitting at the table, at least a subject-matter expert from the 
Army on this. 
 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Do you want to say something about 

MS. SIMON:  I guess we can bring it up in the work 

MR. SHULMAN:  I would only observe that since the 

 

MS. SIMON:  That would be very helpful. 

 

14 

MR. SHULMAN:  And if we want to discuss it at the next 

MS. SIMON:  Okay. 
MR. SHULMAN:  I'll just talk to the Corps, and we can 

MS. SIMON:  Actually, I'm not going to be here. 
MR. SHULMAN:  All right.  Whatever -- 
MS. SIMON:  Nobody from AFGE -- 
MR. SHULMAN:  Whatever next meeting, I mean whenever -

 
meeting, I can make those arrangements with Army. 
 
 
 
 
- if it's December, that's fine too. 
 
 
make sure it happens. 
 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Okay.  Maybe we can get them to 
come to a work group meeting when we have it on the agenda for 
the work group.  We'll talk about that a little later. 
 
 
 
 
Business items for today, unless there's something that people 
want to bring up now. 
 
 
always in order. 

MR. SHULMAN:  That's fine.  Thank you. 
MS. SIMON:  Okay. 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  That would be very helpful. 
Well, is there any other -- so we actually have no New 

[No audible response.] 
CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, a motion to adjourn is 

 

15 

MS. SIMON:  I guess we're all mumbling in here 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Yeah, we'll find out.    MR. 

Yes, you knew I was going to do this. 
This is Tammy Vankeuren's last meeting as the Air 

MS. SIMON:  I move that we adjourn. 
MR. SHULMAN:  Move seconded. 
 

 
 
 
because we're so close together.  We don't think we have to talk 
loudly.  I hope the recording gets it. 
 
SHULMAN:  One last item for the record. 
 
 
Force representative to FPRAC.  Tammy is taking on a new 
challenge with my friends at the Department of Navy and will 
potentially be aware of the stuff that goes on in this committee 
but not necessarily representing the Department.  So we wanted 
to wish her a fond farewell and thanks for her service -- 
 
 
floor open to you if you wanted to say anything. 
 
 
Patricia Adams, so looking forward to the new challenge. 
 
 

MS. VANKEUREN:  Thank you very much. 
MR. SHULMAN: -- for the Air Force, and we'll leave the 

MS. VANKEUREN:  Thank you very much. 
I'll start on Monday as the Staff Director for Ms. 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  Well, congratulations. 
MS. VANKEUREN:  Thank you very much. 

 

16 

CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:  We are sorry to lose you from 

 
FPRAC, but good luck to you in your new position. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
earlier motion, we are adjourned. 

MS. VANKEUREN:  Thank you. 
MR. WILLIAMS:  Welcome aboard. 
MS. VANKEUREN:  Thank you.
