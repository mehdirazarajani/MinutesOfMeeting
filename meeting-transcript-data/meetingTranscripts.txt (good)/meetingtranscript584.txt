                        P R O C E E D I N G

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Well, good morning, everyone,

and welcome to this, our 584th meeting of the Federal

Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee.     My name is Sheldon

Friedman, Chair of the Committee, and as usual, why don't

we go around and introduce ourselves, so let's start with

you today, Mark.

           MR. ALLEN:     Mark Allen with OPM.

           MR. RUMBLE:     Steve Rumble, Department of Defense.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    I believe we have a

Management member on the phone.

           MR. BOB KERR:    It is Bob Kerr from Air Force.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Thank you.

           And here?

           MR. SHORE:    Robert Shore from NAGE.

           MR. LANDIS:    Steve Landis from ACT.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Thank you.

           And people around the sides of the room can

introduce themselves.

           MS. ROBERTS:    Brenda Roberts, Designated Federal

Officer.

           MS. JACOBSON:    Jeanne Jacobson, OPM.
                                                               4


          MR. FENDT:    Karl Fendt, DoD.

          MR. BRADY:    Jim Brady, DoD.

          MR. EICHER:     Mike Eicher, OPM.

          MS. GONZALEZ:    Madeline Gonzalez with OPM.

          MS. DORSEY:     Jennifer Dorsey, OPM.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Thank you.

          Well, we obviously don't have a quorum, so we

can't take any votes, but we can probably get a few things

done that we need to get done today.

          People have in their folder the memorandum about

Prevailing Rate Pay Adjustments for Fiscal Year 2013.    I'd

be astonished if there were any questions about it, but if

there are, fire away.

          MR. ALLEN:    Mr. Chairman, I probably should say

something for the record about this and say what it

actually is.

          Every year since Fiscal Year 1978, the Federal

Wage System has been operating under pay caps, and part of

what this memorandum does is continue that policy of

capping, but the cap is actually zero percent for the rest

of this fiscal year and for the preceding part of the

fiscal year from today.
                                                               5


          OPM issued this memorandum to agencies to provide

them with instructions on how to issue wage schedules under

the pay freeze legislation, and this memorandum covers only

Fiscal Year 2013.   The pay freeze extends through the

remainder of this calendar year.

          Typically, what happens with Federal Wage System

adjustments is that there is appropriations legislation

that covers whether there's a pay cap or what we also call

a floor increase, which is also referred to in this

memorandum.   Those provisions would usually be contained in

an appropriations law that may or may not pass before the

end of this fiscal year.   Typically, they don't pass that

early, but I'm always hopeful that the Congress will pass

legislation for these provisions at some point in this

calendar year.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Any discussion?   Questions?

          [No audible response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    If not, let's move on to the

review of the transcript of our March meeting.    I believe

everybody has a copy of that in your packets.

          Are there any changes besides those that we've

already heard from you about?
                                                                  6


             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, is there agreement

that we should adopt the transcript?

             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   I see no dissenting nods or

whatever, so the transcript of our last meeting is adopted.

Thank you.

             And that brings up old business.    We do have

quite a few old business items.       Are there any that people

would like to discuss today?

             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, we can defer those.

             MR. ALLEN:   Actually, I have a couple of

suggestions.

             There are a few items of old business that have

to do with wage area redefinitions based on changes in

Metropolitan Statistical Area definitions.      OPM is now in

receipt of the new MSA definitions, so what I would

actually recommend is we get in touch with the other

members who are not here today just to withdraw some of

these items from the agenda and at some point in the future

replace them once we've had a chance to look at the new MSA
                                                                7


definitions, which may impact some of these.    We don't want

to approve something that's out of date.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Do you know now if any of the

changes affect any of the pending old business items?

          MR. ALLEN:    We have not looked at them in detail

yet.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Seems to me, we ought to

narrow that just to those where we know it's --

          MR. ALLEN:    We also have new commuting patterns.

So, in one way or another, these proposals that are on the

agenda now are out of date because we're relying on

commuting patterns from the year 2000, the 2000 Census.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   All right.   Well,

maybe if you could let us know exactly which ones you think

ought to be withdrawn pending updated MSA and commuting

data?

          Any question about that or discussion?

          MR. RUMBLE:   No.

          MR. LANDIS:   No.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   Anything else under

old business that people would like to bring up now?

          MR. LANDIS:   Yeah.   I'd just like to ask -- I
                                                                 8


know, I understand we're getting or have new directors now

of OPM and maybe even OMB.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Well, there's an Acting

Director here, Elaine Kaplan, who had been the General

Counsel of OPM.

           MR. LANDIS:    Can you spell his last name for me,

please?

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    It's a woman.   Elaine.

           MR. LANDIS:    Oh, Elaine.   I'm sorry.   I thought

you said "Lane."   I'm sorry.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    K-a-p-l-a-n.

           And OMB, there are changes also -- anybody want

to respond to that?

           MR. ALLEN:    OMB's new director was confirmed a

couple of weeks ago.     I believe her name is Burwell.

           MR. LANDIS:    "Burwell" or "Birdwell"

           MR. ALLEN:    "Bur," B-u-r-w-e-l-l.

           MR. LANDIS:    Have we got any -- I'm sure they're

too new.   Have we gotten any feedback on them on their

opinion of the report we filed last year that I keep

bringing up at every meeting?

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I don't have anything new
                                                                 9


from them, but I haven't had any conversations with them

about this matter.

          MR. ALLEN:     No decision has been rendered on that

by OPM yet.

          MR. LANDIS:    Okay.

          I had one other thing.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Sure, go ahead.

          MR. LANDIS:    More of old stuff here.    I had

somebody give me this.    This is more specific now to the

situation at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, and this is

just -- it was in a newspaper article, and it was talking

about back in 2009, the impending new Joint Base that they

were creating.   And it was talking about then efforts by

Congressman John Adler, the late John Adler, and the Office

of Personnel Management announce the Joint Base will

include the new higher New York locality pay.      Official

said this new rule is an important step toward ensuring

that all Federal civilian employees at Joint Base will be

paid equally for the same job, and this will go into effect

October 11th, 2009.

          And, obviously, I brought this up many times, and

we all know that that never got done.
                                                                   10


            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Is that a newspaper article?

            MR. LANDIS:   Yes.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Would you like that submitted

for the record and circulated to the Committee?        We can do

that.

            MR. LANDIS:   Yeah, I can do that, if you like.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Sure.   Can you send it?    Give

it to Madeline, please.

            MR. LANDIS:   Okay.

            MS. GONZALEZ:   Can I keep that copy?

            MR. LANDIS:   That's the only one I have,

unfortunately.

            MS. GONZALEZ:   Okay.

            MR. ALLEN:    Is it an Internet article?    If it's

that, you can just send us a link.

            MR. LANDIS:   Okay.   I could probably do that.

It's old.   I don't know if it will even be there, but I can

see if I can find it.

                 The link is right at the bottom.      If the

link still works, I’ll send it to Madeline.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Well, thanks for bringing

that to our attention.
                                                                 11


           MR. LANDIS:   Okay.

           And the other thing is something we have

discussed before on our Survey Issues Workgroup --

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Mm-hmm.

           MR. LANDIS:   I think, it's page 14.   I

highlighted the area we're talking about, I guess, the

policy has generally been to keep FWS employees in National

Forests, National Parks, and military installations on the

same wage area, and when these issues are brought before

OPM's attention, they're dealt with on an ad hoc basis.

And, again, you know, that's something that was never done

here at McGuire.

           I keep bringing these things up because, you

know, this is the number-one issue back there, and it's

hurting, it's hurting morale back there, and there's people

that are leaving the position down there to find employment

elsewhere because of that.

           So I just wanted to bring these things up.        I

know we have done pretty much -- and you've said this

before.   We've done pretty much everything we can do here,

but I just like to keep that -- you know, put it in the

record and keep it to the attention of everyone.      It's
                                                                12


something that's gone on 3 1/2, almost 4 years now that

this -- that the wage area change that was promised was

never dealt with, and I just was hoping there was something

that we could do maybe to urge someone to make some kind of

decision on this.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   I'm happy to entertain any

specific suggestion about what else we could do.

             MR. LANDIS:   I don't --

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   We've recommended as a

Committee to our Director that the matter be fixed --

             MR. LANDIS:   Mm-hmm.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN: -- in the context of a larger

change in regulation, but if there's something else you can

think of or we can think of to do --

             MR. LANDIS:   I don't know.   Just maybe like we

have the two new -- the Acting Director and the new

Director of OMB.    Maybe it's something that we could run by

them now.    I'm sure they may not even be aware of this

situation.    Maybe they have a different outlook on fixing

it.

             But I know that a lot of times, it's brought up

that we can't really do anything until the pay freeze is
                                                                  13


done, but, obviously, this occurred well before the pay

freeze was implemented.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Right.

             MR. LANDIS:   So I don't see that that should have

any effect on it.

             And, again, it's not an increase in the wage

grade pay.    It's just a change, which we've done, you know,

many times since then, and we have seen reports of other

areas that had effect on people that put them into a higher

wage area since this time.

             And that's another thing that's very frustrating

to people back at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.       They

read these articles in other areas getting these wage area

upgrades, and they don't know why they're being overlooked

for all this time.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Yeah.    Well, thank you, and

maybe we can think of something else we can do.

             Anything else on this point that Steve brought

up?

             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Any other old business item

people would like to discuss?
                                                                  14


             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    And if not, we have no new

business items on the agenda, but are there any others that

people want to bring up?

             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Oh, I'm sorry.   We have a

Committee member who didn't get a chance to introduce

herself earlier.

             MS. BOYD:   Yes.    Stephanie Boyd from VA.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Thank you.   Thank you for

coming.   Okay.

             Any new business?

             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   Well, if there is no

objection, we could adjourn.

             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Hearing no objection, we're

adjourned.    Thank you all.     See you in June.
