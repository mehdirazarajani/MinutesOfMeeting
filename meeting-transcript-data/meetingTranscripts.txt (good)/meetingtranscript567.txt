          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Good morning, everyone, and

welcome to this 567th meeting of the Federal Prevailing Rate

Advisory Committee.    My name is Sheldon Friedman.   I am the

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Okay.   Well, thank you,

everyone.

            I don't have any announcements, so that's going to

make that a short part of the agenda.         Does anyone else?

            [No audible response.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, we actually have two

sets of minutes or transcripts to approve.         I apologize for

the typo -- oh, it got corrected.      Okay.     I had an earlier

version.    Never mind.    From the two meetings ago and the
                                                                   5


prior meeting, I guess we should discuss these separately.

           Has everyone had a chance to review the transcript

from the 565th meeting, and are there any other changes

beyond those that have already been sent in to us?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, is there agreement to

adopt the transcript?

           MR. SHULMAN:   Yes.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I see nods.   Okay.   It's

agreed.   Excellent.

           And has everyone had a chance to review the

transcript of the last meeting?      Are there any other changes

beyond those that have already been sent in to us?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     So, hearing no objection, that

transcript is adopted, too.      Thank you very much.

           We have a number of old business items.       I think

all but one are really in the -- well, all but possibly two

are in the purview of the work group, but (e) is something

we could talk about today, abolishment of Montgomery,

Pennsylvania, as a nonappropriated fund wage area.

           We've been pondering this for a couple of meetings

now.   The Management side has informed me, they're going to
                                                                 6


be a little short-handed today.     So, if we actually came to

a vote on something, we'd have to wait until next month to

vote, but we can certainly discuss this one if anyone wants

to.

             MR. ALLEN:   I do have something to update

everybody on.    At our last meeting, OPM staff were asked to

look back at some of the rationales for previous

nonappropriated fund wage area abolishment.     We're still in

the process of doing that, but at this point, we've gone

back to around 1994 to identify which counties were

redefined to which wage areas.     Now the next part of this is

to figure out what the rationale behind each one actually

was.

             What I've looked at so far seems to indicate that

FPRAC has been very flexible.     I wasn't actually surprised

with that.    There have been different rationales at

different points for different wage areas that we need to

take a closer look at to see if there are really any

discernable patterns between how counties are defined to

other survey areas once a wage area is abolished.

             MS. SIMON:   Are you specifically looking for cases

where the cluster of counties that had previously been

together was retained as a cluster?
                                                                  7


            MR. ALLEN:   Yes.

            MS. SIMON:   Okay.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Any other discussion today on

this one?

            [No audible response.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, I would suggest we

defer it to the next meeting.

            MR. ALLEN:   We should have more information at the

next meeting on this.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Is there anything that AFGE

wants to bring up about item (f) under old business at this

point?

            [No audible response.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Defer that one?   Okay.

            This could be a record, in my short tenure anyway.

            Well, I don't have any new business items.     Does

anyone else?

            [No audible response.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, we could adjourn, if

we would like to do so.

            MR. ALLEN:   I would just like to note for the

record that we do have a working group meeting --

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Yes.
                                                                 8


             MR. ALLEN:    -- after this meeting, so we'll

probably be in there for quite a while.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    And I think it's a good day

for us to have a lot of time for that.       After we adjourn,

we'll take a 5-minute break and reconvene in the Small

Pendleton Room for the working group meeting.

             Is there a motion to adjourn?

             MR. SHULMAN:    Motion to adjourn.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Second?

             MS. SIMON:    Seconded.

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.   And hearing no

objection -- is there no objection?

             [No audible response.]

             CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    I don't hear one, so we are

adjourned.    Thank you.    See you in 5 minutes.

                                •-•-•
