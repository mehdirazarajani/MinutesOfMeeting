                        P R O C E E D I N G S

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Good morning, everyone, and

welcome to this 571st meeting of FPRAC.          My name is Sheldon

Friedman.    I am the Chairman of FPRAC, and as usual, why don't

we go around and introduce ourselves.

            Would you start today, Mark?

            MR. ALLEN:     Mark Allen with OPM.

            MR. SHULMAN:     Seth Shulman, Department of Defense.

            MS. VANKEUREN:     Tammy Vankeuren, Air Force.

            MR. WILLIAMS:     Lamar Williams, Department of the Navy.

Department.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    And I think we have somebody on

the phone?    Pamela, would you please introduce yourself for the

recorder?
                                                                    6


         MS. SOKOL:     Pamela Sokol with Army.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Thank you.   Good morning.

         Now let's go around this side of the room.

         MS. AVONDET:     Terri Avondet, OPM.

         MS. GONZALEZ:     Madeline Gonzalez with OPM.

         MS. FREEMAN:     Darlene Freeman, Air Force.

         MS. ARROYO:     Melissa Arroyo, Department of Navy.

         MR. FENDT:     Karl Fendt, DoD.

         MS. BERNSTROM:     Sarah Bernstrom, DoD.

         MS. GRAY:     Febbie Gray, OPM.

         MR. WALLACE:     Chris Wallace, OPM.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Thank you all.

         Are there any announcements for our group?

         [No response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    If not, we will move on to the

review of the transcript of our last meeting.       Are there any

changes that people have to that transcript beyond those that

you have already submitted?
                                                                       7


            [No response.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    If not, is there agreement that we

should accept the transcript?

            MS. SIMON:   Yes.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Great.    The transcript is

accepted.

            That brings up Old Business, and with the Committee's

indulgence, I would suggest that we move straight to Item (f),

the report of the Wage Area Definition Study Group,

570-MGT/LBR-1, and all the related updates that are listed under

the New Business section.       I know this is quite a large chunk of

material.

            The study group is also still continuing its work, but

while we are here, this would be an opportunity to begin

discussion, if people want to do that, of this interim report.

            MS. SIMON:   I would move that we defer our discussion

of these updates until the work group has completed its work.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.    Well, would the people on

this side of the table wish to discuss?

            MR. ALLEN:   I think that is probably the best thing to

do.   We still have a few more working group meetings scheduled
                                                                    8


in order to complete the report.     I don't think we are really at

a point right now where we can have an informed discussion about

what the eventual final report will look like, but I think we

are pretty close to completing it.     I think we are making pretty

good progress.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Okay.    I guess I should note that

the members of the study group have a fresh bunch of material

that Madeline circulated several days ago, and shortly after

this meeting, we will convene a study group meeting.

         Well, this could be a new -- I thought we set a record

late last year for brief meetings, but we might beat it today,

unless there's some New Business item I am not aware of.     Is

there any other New Business item?

         [No response.]

         MS. SIMON:   No.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, motion to adjourn would be

         MR. ALLEN:   Mr. Chairman, I would like to mention that

we have scheduled an additional FPRAC meeting on March the 8th -

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Right.

         MR. ALLEN:   -- which had not previously been

announced.   This is primarily to take a look at the working
                                                                 9


groups' efforts.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Yeah.   We thought it would be

important to have two meetings in March to make sure we have

time to wrap up and discuss fully the report of the study group.

          So back to the motion, there was a motion on the

floor.   Is there any objection?

          [No response.]

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Hearing none, we are adjourned.   I

will see some of you in the study group shortly.
