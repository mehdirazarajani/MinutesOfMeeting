                      P R O C E E D I N G

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Good morning everyone, and

welcome to this, our 590th meeting of the Federal

Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee.    My name is Sheldon

Friedman, Chair of the Committee.

         As usual, why don't we go around and introduce

ourselves.   We'll start with you today, Bill.

         MR. FENAUGHTY:     Bill Fenaughty from NFFE,

representing Metal Trades.

         MR. SHORE:     Rob Shore from NAGE.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Steve, you're on the phone,

right?

         MR. LANDIS:    Yes.   Steve Landis, Association of

Civilian Technicians.

         MR. ALLEN:     Mark Allen with OPM.

         MS. SOKOL:     Pamela Sokol, Department of Army.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Thank you.

         And if the people around the edge of the room

could also introduce themselves?

         MS. GONZALEZ:     Madeline Gonzalez with OPM.

         MS. ROBERTS:     Brenda Roberts, OPM, Designated

Federal Officer.
                                                               4


          MR. LYNCH:    Luis Lynch, Air Force.

          MR. KISTNER:    Gary Kistner, DCPAS, Wage and

Salary.

          MR. FENDT:    Karl Fendt, DoD.

          MR. BRADY:    Jim Brady, DoD.

          MR. EICHER:    Mike Eicher, OPM.

          MS. STOVALL:    Brenda Stovall, OPM.

          MS. MANCHESTER:    Brittney Manchester, OPM.

          MS. WALLACE:    Terri Wallace, OPM.

          MR. GREGORY:    Adair Gregory, NAGE.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Thank you, everyone.

          The only announcement I have is that we received

a communication from Captain Hanrahan concerning our

deliberations at the last meeting, and I have circulated

that to everyone.   We are preparing a response, which I

will also share once we have that ready.

          I should also mention that the Work Group meeting

that's going to be held after the FPRAC meeting is not in

the usual place.    It's going to be on the seventh floor in

7H31, so we can accommodate the mapping software

demonstration.

          Any questions or discussion about the
                                                                 5


communication from Captain Hanrahan?

           [No audible response.]

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, can we move on to the

review of the transcript of our last meeting?

           MR. ALLEN:   Mr. Chairman, I have one announcement

that's not on our agenda.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Sure.

           MR. ALLEN:   It has to do with the Prevailing Rate

Adjustments for FY 2014, which has been of keen interest.

           The House of Representatives passed legislation,

I believe yesterday, that would provide for a 1 percent

uniform pay adjustment for prevailing rate employees in FY

2014, retroactive back to the wage area’s normal effective

date.

           I believe the Senate is supposed to pass it this

weekend.   Once that happens and the President signs the

legislation, OPM will issue implementing guidance to the

heads of agencies and the Department of Defense will begin

issuing wage schedules.

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Thank you, Mark.   I know that

is of interest to everyone.

           Any questions about that?
                                                                  6


         MR. SHORE:    Is there a time table, roughly, as to

when the increases will kick in, assuming it passes?

         MR. ALLEN:    OPM will most likely get the guidance

out next week, and then the Department of Defense will

begin issuing wage schedules.

         As I mentioned, some of the wage schedules would

be retroactive.   For instance, The Washington, DC, wage

area has a wage schedule that is normally effective in

October of the new fiscal year.     So the FY 2014 wage

schedule would be retroactive to its calendar year October

2013 effective date.

         MR. FENAUGHTY:      Mark, are the effective dates

different for all the wage areas?

         MR. ALLEN:    Yes.    There are some FY 2014 wage

schedules that are normally adjusted, say, in February or

March or April, and therefore those schedules won't be

adjusted until their normal effective dates.

         MR. FENAUGHTY:      So there won't be any

retroactivity for those?

         MR. ALLEN:    No.    There will be no need for a

retroactive pay adjustment for those schedules.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Okay.   Anything else on that?
                                                               7


         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Regarding the transcript of

our last meeting, are there any other corrections that

people would like to bring to our attention?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    If not, is there agreement to

adopt the transcript of our last meeting?    Anyone who

disagrees with that idea?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Hearing no disagreement, the

transcript of our last meeting is adopted.

         Any Old Business items that people want to bring

up this morning?   A couple of them are pending work that's

under way in the Work Group.

         MR. LANDIS:   Sheldon, may I ask a question?

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Sure thing, Steve.

         MR. LANDIS:   Okay.   I’m just bringing up some

other old stuff.   When Congress, when both the House and

Senate have passed the bill and the wage freeze is

officially over for the FWS employees, will that have an

impact on getting FPRAC’s report and recommendation

approved by the Director of OPM?   It was sent to the
                                                                8


Director almost 2 years ago.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     I don't personally have

anything new to report on that, but perhaps others do.

         Mark, do you have any information on that?

         MR. ALLEN:    The FPRAC recommendation to use GS

locality pay areas when defining Federal Wage System wage

area boundaries is still under review by OPM.

         MR. LANDIS:   Okay.    That's the same information

we've been getting for a while now.      Any idea on how long

it's going to be under review before they make a decision?

         MR. ALLEN:    No.   I can't say that.

         MR. LANDIS:   Okay.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Is there any other Old

Business item people would like to bring up this morning?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, I'm not aware of any

New Business items, but if people have any new business,

this would be the time to say so.       Any new business?

         MR. SHORE:    I have a question.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Sure.

         MR. SHORE:    And if I missed it, then I apologize.

Did we end up putting something in writing after our
                                                                  9


discussion last week regarding the recommendation for Motor

Vessel Ranger III employees?      I know we orally made a

decision.    I don’t remember if anything was officially

written down in terms of the recommendation.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    There is a draft letter in

progress communicating OPM's decision in this matter.        It

has to be approved by the Director of OPM before the letter

is sent to the Department of the Interior.

            Do you want to add to that, Mark?

            MR. ALLEN:   No.   That pretty much covers it.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    It will be public information

that we can share.

            So if there's no new business, we can move on to

our Work Group meeting.     It would be in order for us to

adjourn if there's no objection.

            [No audible response.]

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Hearing no objection, we're

adjourned, and we'll reconvene in about 10 minutes upstairs

in 7H31.
