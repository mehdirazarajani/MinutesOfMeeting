                           P R O C E E D I N G

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Good morning, everyone, and

welcome to this, our 595th meeting of the Federal Prevailing

Rate Advisory Committee.     My name is Sheldon Friedman, Chair of

the Committee, and as we usually do, let’s start with

introductions.

           Let's start with you today, Mark.

           MR. ALLEN:    Mark Allen with OPM.

           MR. PEDERSEN:     David Pedersen, Navy.

           MR. BUCK:    Gary Buck, Army.

           MR. FENAUGHTY:    Bill Fenaughty, Metal Trades and NFFE.

           MS. ARCHER:    Candace Archer, AFGE.

           MR. GREGORY:     Adair Gregory, NAGE.

           MR. LANDIS:    Steven Landis, ACT.

           MS. SIMON:    Jacque Simon, AFGE (via phone).

           CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Let's go around the rest of the

room, as well, please.

           MS. JACOBSON: Jeanne Jacobson, OPM, Designated Federal

Officer.

           MR. LYNCH:     Luis Lynch, Air Force.

           MS. SCHULBERG:    Tracy Schulberg, Navy.
                                                                    4


         MS. CHAVES:     Becky Chaves, DoD.

         MR. EICHER:     Mike Eicher, OPM.

         MS. ROCKER:     Miranda Rocker, OPM.

         MS. GONZALEZ:    Madeline Gonzalez, OPM.

         MS. WALLACE:     Terri Wallace, OPM.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Thank you, everyone, and welcome

again.

         I have no announcements this morning.      Does anyone

else have any announcements?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, let's move to review the

minutes of our previous meeting.    Are there any changes that

people want to bring to our attention that you haven't already

told us about?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     If not, is there any objection to

adopting the transcript of our last meeting?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Hearing no objection, the

transcript is adopted.

         That brings up Old Business.     Is there any item (a)

through (d) on the agenda that people would like to talk about
                                                                   5


this morning?

         MS. SIMON:   This is Jacque Simon.   I just want to

bring up item (c), the third item on the list of Old Business,

our request for an FPRAC review of our proposal to redefine

Monroe County, Pennsylvania, from the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre wage

area to the New York wage area.   Of course, this is one element

in the proposal that FPRAC passed in October of 2010 that has

languished now for several years, so everyone has been politely

pretending it doesn't exist, but it exists.

         The affected employees, those who are the hourly

employees, are in numerous locations around the country; in this

case at Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania, but we all know

that there are other locations, as well.

         This disparate treatment between salaried and hourly

federal employees is really a scandal that shouldn't be allowed

to continue to exist, and President Cox has asked me to bring

this up again to try to bring some kind of reckoning through

FPRAC, so that some attention can be paid to this by the

Director of the Office of Personnel Management.   Certainly,

every question about the impact and implementation of this

proposal has been answered to the nth degree.   Our members are

very frustrated.   President Cox is beyond frustrated, and we
                                                                      6


want some action.   We want some attention, and we want some

movement on this issue.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Is there something specific you're

asking from FPRAC at this point, Jacque?

          MS. SIMON:   Yes.    I'd like FPRAC to reaffirm its

support for this proposal and ask directly that OPM Director

Katherine Archuleta respond and take action on this

recommendation.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Is that in the form of a motion?

          MS. SIMON:   It doesn't have to be in the form of a

motion.   This is a request from AFGE, AFGE President J. David

Cox.   He asked me to convey this to you, to the FPRAC Committee.

          CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     Okay.   I'm trying to think how we

take action on this. It seems to me we would need to have

something from AFGE to pass on to the Director.

          MS. SIMON:   Okay.    I'll put something in writing,

specifically asking the Chairman of FPRAC to forward to the

Director of OPM a request for action, because you know, 3-1/2

years is long enough to wait for a decision. The proposal has

just been sitting on the desk of the Director of OPM.     We are

now on our second Director that has this proposal on her desk,

and the time for action has long passed, so certainly, it needs
                                                                       7


to occur now.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Okay.   Well, I certainly hear you.

All right.    So you're going to give us something in writing on

that then, right?    --

            MS. SIMON:    Yes.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Okay.   We actually don't have a

quorum on the Management side this morning.        Once we have

something in writing, we can take it from there.

            Steve?

            MR. LANDIS:   I would just like to add on to what

Jacque said, as well.      This has definitely been a point of

frustration for all of us, as well as the fact that Joint Base

McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has been an issue now for almost 5 years,

as of October of 2009 when they were combined in one military

facility.    GS workers were all given the New York pay scale,

which is what the eastern portion of the base were paid, and the

FWS employees were left out of that.

            It was an oversight.   It has been recommended by the

Congressmen and the Senators from the State of New Jersey to

correct this.    Again, this has been something that has been

going on since October of 2009.

            We have documentation from past meetings that it is
                                                                          8


general OPM policy that when one facility is split between two

wage areas, it is combined within one wage area, but these

things have just been left hanging in the breeze now for years.

         We're having turnover issues.       We have people that are

coming in to work as technicians.       They are employed for a

couple years but then they get frustrated with their pay.          They

get more experience, and then they take jobs elsewhere.       So

we're having turnovers.       We have an issue there with retention,

and it's something that needs to be addressed and fixed, sooner

rather than later.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Thank you, Steve.

         Well, of course, we even heard from the former Base

Commander about this.

         Is there anything that the Management side would like

to say in response at this point?

         MR. ALLEN:     No.    The Management members' position has

not changed on the overall AFGE proposal and the FPRAC

recommendation by majority vote is still under consideration by

the Director of OPM.    I don't have any further information on

that, that I can share today.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       Any further discussion at this

time?
                                                                           9


            Steve.

            MR. LANDIS:   I also received some contact from

Congressman Jon Runyan's office.      Half of the Joint Base is in

his district.    I believe that next year's National Defense

Authorization Act contains language in it that is directed to

correct this issue, as well.      I'm not exactly sure.   It seems

like that is going to get through the House and the Senate.          But

I don't know.    I have also heard rumors that the President is

threatening to veto it.

            I don't have all the exact details of that bill, but--

            MS. SIMON:    This is Jacque Simon.   Representative

Runyan never offered his amendment.      He withdrew it, presumably

because the Rules Committee had some objection.       So it was never

actually offered, so it is not part of the NDAA this year.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Anything else on this matter?

            MS. SIMON:    We know the Congressman is very interested

in rectifying this, but it is not going to be part of the

National Defense Authorization Act for 2015.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Anything else on this matter this

morning?

            MR. ALLEN:    Mr. Chairman, I have a procedural

question.    The agenda item that we are considering under this
                                                                    10


discussion is agenda item (c), which is the letter from AFGE

that just had to do with Monroe County, Pennsylvania.

         Jacque, are we just talking about Monroe County,

Pennsylvania, or are we talking about the overall FPRAC

recommendation from October 2010?

         MS. SIMON:   We are talking about both our request for

the redefinition of Monroe County and the proposal that was

adopted by FPRAC in October of 2010 that would have resolved the

issue, not only for Monroe County, Pennsylvania, but for

numerous other counties throughout the country.

         MR. ALLEN:   Okay.

         MS. SIMON:   The answer is both, not either/or.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   Anything else on this?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:

         So are there any other (a) through (d) items of Old

Business that people want to talk about this morning?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:   If not, I suggest we move on to

item (e), on which at this point, we have accumulated quite a

few different exhibits, data, analysis, and so forth.     We have

received the Management proposal.   I think we are still awaiting
                                                                  11


a definite Labor proposal.    The Labor side has indicated that

the Management proposal is not acceptable to the Labor folks.

         We could summarize some of the background again, but I

think we have done that at previous meetings.

         Is there any discussion at this point of this question

of the disposition of the Portland, Maine, wage area?

         MR. ALLEN:   Mr. Chairman, if I may, I can kind of boil

down what I think are the essential issues on this.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Sure.

         MR. ALLEN:   The Management proposal recommends that

the current Portland wage area be split into two parts, with

some of the counties going to the Augusta, Maine, wage area and

some to the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, wage area.

         It is my understanding that the Labor members would

prefer that the Portland wage area's counties be kept together

and be put into the Portsmouth wage area.

         And the other issue is whether to continue having

surveys conducted in one of the counties in the Portland wage

area where there is a very large private sector employer.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:     There are three survey counties in

the current Portland wage area, so there is the question of

their status, do they continue as survey counties or not -- all
                                                                         12


three of them or fewer?       Those answers need to be part of our

eventual recommendation.

            Any discussion on this one?

            MR. FENAUGHTY:    Just a question.     What I remember from

May was that Labor was going to work on getting a proposal

together.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    That was my understanding.     I

don't think we have received it yet, though.

            MR. FENAUGHTY:    Jacque, is that your understanding of

where we're at with this?

            MS. SIMON:   Bill, I could hear that you were talking,

but I couldn't make out what you said.         Did you say that we are

still working on our Labor response to Management's proposal?

            MR. FENAUGHTY:    Yes.     And that's pretty much where

we're at.    We still owe the Committee a proposal regarding this

issue on the Portland wage area.

            MS. SIMON:   Yes, that’s correct.

            MR. FENAUGHTY:     Okay.

            CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:    Okay.     Well, I think I am going to

suggest we defer any further discussion of this issue until we

receive that proposal.       Is that agreeable?

            MR. ALLEN:   That sounds like a good idea to me.
                                                                     13


         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Okay.

         MR. ALLEN:       I don't think there's anything urgent on

the timeline for the wage survey in Portland that would impede

the start of the wage change survey.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Well, the thing that concerns me a

little is presumably the survey is being conducted without Labor

participation at this point.      Ms. Chaves, would you happen to

know if that is correct?

         MS. CHAVES:      I'm sorry.    I would not know.

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Okay.    That is a concern to me.

         Anyway, we do need one more piece of data before we

can move ahead on this.

         Well, I have no New Business today.        Does anyone else?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:       We do have a working group meeting

scheduled shortly after we adjourn here, but if there is no new

business, it would be entirely appropriate for us to adjourn.

Is there any objection to adjourning?

         [No audible response.]

         CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN:      Hearing no objection, we are

adjourned, so see everyone in July.       And have a good first month

of summer.   Stay cool.    Thank you.
