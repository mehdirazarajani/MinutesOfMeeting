A further way in which the security perimeter has partly moved to the cli ent side is through the widespread use of e - mail as 4n extended authentication mechanism . A huge number of today ' s applications cohtain " forgotten password " functions that allow an attacker to generate an account recovery e - mail to any registered address , without requiring any other user - specific information . This allows an attacker who compromises a user ' s web mail account to easily escalate the attack and compromise the victim ' s accounts on most of the web applications for which the victim is registered . The Future of Web Application Security Over a decade after their widespread adoption , web applications on the Internet today are still rife with vulnerabilities . Understanding of the security threats facing web applications , and effective ways of addressing these are still underde veloped within the industry .

Even though old and well - understood vulnerabilities such as SQL injection continue to appear , their prevalence is gradually diminishing .

New research in these areas is generally focused on developing advanced techniques for attacking more subtle manifestations of vulnerabilities that a few years ago could be easily detected and exploited using only a browser . A second prominent trend has been a gradual shift in attention from attacks against the server side of the application to those that target application users . The latter kind of attack still leverages defects within the application itself , but it generally involves some kind of interaction with another user to compromise that user ' s dealings with the vulnerable application . This is a trend that has been replicated in other areas of software security .

MULTIPLE HYPOTHESIS TRACKING FOR OVERLAPPING SPEAKER SEGMENTATION AIDAN O . T . HOGG , CHRISTINE EVERS AND PATRICK A . NAYLOR DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING , IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON , UK SPEECH AND AUDIO Imperial CollcgPROCESSING London LAB 1 . Overview & Proposed system 2 . Motivation Microphone Spectral peak detector to the blue and the best Harmonic subset generation What does this paper propose ? A multiple hypothesis tracking ( MHT ) method that exploits the harmonic structure associated with the pitch in voiced speech in order to segment the onsets of speech from multiple , overlapping speakers . How well does this proposed method perform ? Comparable segmentation performance can be achieved for overlapping speech when evaluated against a deep learning approach . which requires labelled training data . Speaker A Speaker B Speaker C Speaker D Multiple hypothesis tracking . What is speaker diarization ? Answers the question “ who spoke when ? " and is required for applications , such as speaker indexing and automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) . Is performing segmentation before clustering really that useful ? If correct segmentation is performed before clustering then each segment will contain the maximum amount of information possible on the speaker ' s identity . . Why use pitch for segmentation ? A study [ 1 ] of meetings in the AMI corpus has shown that a pitch change is a strong indicator of a speaker change . 1st Kalman filter . . . .
