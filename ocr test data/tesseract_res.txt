‘A further way in which the security perimeter has partly moved to the cli-
‘ent side is through the widespread use of e-mail as jn extended authentication
mechanism. A huge number of today’s applications cohtain “forgotten password”
functions that allow an attacker to generate an account recovery e-mail to any
registered address, without requiring any other user-specific information. This,
allows an attacker who compromises a user's web mail account to easily escalate
the attack and compromise the victims accounts on most ofthe web applications
for which the victim is registred.

The Future of Web Application security

‘Over a decade after their widespread adoption, web applications on the Internet
today are still rife with vulnerabilities. Understanding of the security threats,
facing web applications, and effective ways of addressing these, are still underde-
‘voloped within the industry. There is currently litle indication that the problem
factors described in this chapter will disappear in the near Future.

‘That said, the details of the web application security landscape are not static.
Even though old and well-understood vulnerabilities such as SQL. injection
continue to appear, their prevalence is gradually diminishing. Furthermore,
the instances that remain are becoming more difficult to find and exploit. New
research in these areas s generally focused on developing advanced techniques
for attacking more subtle manifestations of vulnerabilities thata few years ag0
‘could be easily detected and exploited using only a browser.

‘A second prominent trend has been a gradual shift in attention from attacks
against the server side of the application to those that target application users.
‘The latter kind of attack stil leverages defects within the application itself, but
it generally involves some kind of interaction with another user to compromise
that user's dealings with the vulnerable application. This is a trend that has
‘boon replicated in other areas of software security. As awareness of security
threats matures laws inthe server side are the first to be well understood and
addressed, leaving the client side asa key battleground as the learning process
continues. OF al the attacks described in this book, those against other users
are evolving the most quickly, and they have been the focus of most research
in recont years.

‘Various recent trends in technology have somewhat altered the landscape of
‘web applications. Popular consciousness about these trends exists by means of
various rather misleading buzzwords, the most prominent of which are these:

‘= Web 2.0 — This term refers to the greater use of functionality thatenables
user-generated content and information sharing, and also the adoption
‘of various technologies that broadly support this functionality, including
asynchronous HTTP requests and cross-domain integration.
