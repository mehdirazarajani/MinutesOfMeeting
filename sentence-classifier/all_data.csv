The last three days I was working hard to solve a problem submitting our UWP app to the store.,Normal
Now I know why it was not working and I want to make my knowledge public.,Normal
We have an UWP app targeting Windows 10 fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously.,Normal
 A new version fails the certification process with “10.4.2 App Crash or Freeze”,Normal
Side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines,Normal
(This package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain),Normal
This package does always crash after side loading it.,Normal
So this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process!,Normal
Now things are very complicated:,Normal
- The uploaded “.appxupload” package contains the .NET dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the Microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup.,Normal
The same build process on my developer machine with the locally installed native tool chain generates perfectly loadable builds.,Normal
Unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process.,Normal
Also Microsoft support could not help me.,Normal
They build a package which fails without details and I can not download the build package for debugging.,Normal
The test-flight certification process builds the same package internally.,Normal
Fortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process.,Normal
So I was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging.,Normal
And it crashed at startup!,Normal
Using some gflags and VS I was able to find that the entry point for “FormatMessage” was not found.,Normal
- Entry point for “FormatMessage” not found: After some searching I found this https://github.com/AArnott/pinvoke/commit/2843cb918562050fd4e6df1f3fca0c72f4812eb4 and yes I was using this library with the old version.,Normal
So the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup.,Normal
But why was it working on my local machine?,Normal
This is because I am using Visual Studio 15.7.1 which has already fixed the problem.,Normal
Unfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process (at least for our targeted OS version: Windows 10 falls creators update) uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs-x?,Normal
After I used the latest version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine.,Normal
- The Microsoft Build server for submitted UWP packages is using a buggy “C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\App Certification Kit\SupportedAPIs-x?,Normal
Local release builds created with the native toolchain of VS 15.7.1 are working.,Normal
Here the SupportedAPIs-x?,Normal
I hope this helps!,Normal
Maybe it will help someone.,Normal

WinRT is littered with Async getters that greatly impede porting code and add unnecessary complexity for many cases.,Normal

I experienced problem with UWP ListView particularly using ISupportIncrementalLoading interface as a datasource.,Normal
A few words about problem context:,Normal
In our UWP app there is a ListView and it uses ISupportIncrementalLoading as a DataSource.,Normal
And while next part of data is loading ListView is disabled.,Normal
So the problem in that if you scroll ListView in way you catch ScrollBar and pull it to the down,Normal
when you scroll to the end of the list ListView will be disabled for some period of time (while data is loading).,Normal
And if you release mouse button from ScrollBar,Normal
while ListView is blocked then some strange behavior of ScrollBar appears after ListView became enabled..,Normal
You cannot hover mouse on ScrollBar because when try to do it ScrollBar goes upper.,Normal
Note 1: I've got success with experiencing this problem in UWP app created from scratch (used ListView and ISupportIncrementalLoading).,Normal
I'd like to attach sample app but I don't understand how (of course if it possible).,Normal
Note 2: if discard of using ISupportIncrementalLoading,Normal
the problem exists but a bit another kind of.,Normal

Issue: I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension (using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex) and currently UWP would not allow me to convert the application from Desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he/she wants.,Normal
This means adding more steps to select something that is already shown on the FileSavePicker dialog which I think it would eventually affect in a way the user experience.,Normal

You know it for sure: one developer produces great software like Google Chrome Paint.net or many others.,Normal
The other developers try to force customers to use their software for example M$ with Edge and Paint 3D.,Normal
M$ even tries to pay customers to use Bing & Edge.,Normal
If necessary you could send your incompetent product managers to the competitors - at least at school so the can learn how great Software has to feel and look like.,Normal
M$ just displays 4 lines.,Normal
It feels like M$ is begging the customers to send no feedback because M$ hates it but must do something.,Normal
This is the crezy idea:,Normal
M$ could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it's just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users.,Normal

With F# still not providing a way to code a full application for the desktop using UWP after several years of people waiting I want to call for bringing Common Lisp to the platform.,Normal

The users that are already subscribed to the Add-on will keep the same price as before but the new Users will get the new price.,Normal

We tried to embrace Microsoft's vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money.,Normal
We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.,Normal
In debug mode it all works fine.,Normal
In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification.,Normal
The smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp),Normal
We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication block,Normal

Both Process Isolation and Hyper-V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server 2016 but Windows 10 only supports Hyper-V isolation.,Normal

Now let's say next day the app is opened again.,Normal
App immediately displays yesterday's news stories and works in background to load new stories (or user pulls to refresh).,Normal
As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView not all but say top 10 and rest goes to the disk/cache.,Normal
Now if user scrolls down more stories are fetched from the cache/disk.,Normal
on Windows 10 UWP apps if you rapidly click or unintentionally double-click on any control supporting click/tapped event its associated Click event handler will execute for each.,Normal
This can cause a lot of unintended side effects.,Normal
For example if the Click event handler brings up a modal ContentDialog with the ShowAsync command an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another ContentDialog which causes an exception if not handled will result in a crash of the application.,Normal

This will be a good addition.,Normal
It is understandable that when UWP app is run normally it can only access a limited set of COM objects; however if the UWP is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional COM objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above.,Normal
Without this support if a desktop bridge contains a UWP app and a win32 app exposes out-of-proc COM objects the only way UWP app can communicate with the win32 app is through AppService.,Normal
This brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add AppService into win32 app and sometimes it is impossible if win32 source code is not available.,Normal
Packaged COM (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/13/com-server-ole-document-support-desktop-bridge/#KgekWJeWFmOwUZRb.97) allows exposing out-of-proc COM objects using desktop bridge however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects.,Normal
We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps.,Normal
It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high.,Normal
Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.,Normal
I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device - but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list - making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users.,Normal
That is fine if we are being kept out by other Xbox apps - but we released an app last week and currently there are about 2 dozens apps ahead of us - half that won't even work on an Xbox with a controller.,Normal
It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem.,Normal
One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX!,Normal
You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One.,Normal
Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section.,Normal
It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it.,Normal
I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device,Normal

Having SOCK_SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user.,Suggestion
It also allows greater compatibility for existing POSIX-compatible applications as was the original goal for implementing AF_UNIX.,Normal

List/GridSwitcher : there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview ( each item expanded fully ) or to a gridview ( normal grid like behaviour ),Suggestion
These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices.,Normal
This can be a very powerful control/page yet looking very good to the eye as well.,Normal

So in a round about way you're actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead.,Normal
Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine.,Normal
This limitation results in a bad user experience because there are scenarios where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content.,Normal
But getting or setting the content doesn't work if the app is in background or unfocused.,Normal
Or the other way around; where one application creates data and sets the content automatically and the user can directly use it inside another application.,Normal
Currently the input will be validated if the focus of the Textbox lost.,Normal

2) This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms (iOS / Android / Mac OSX).,Normal
This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms.,Normal

So what is the suggestion:,Normal
As a Xamarin.Forms developer I had to drill down 4 frameworks to find this limitation.,Normal
As bad as the Android docs are they at least make an effort to publish limits.,Normal

ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons: locking and placement.,Normal
Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(11) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource).,Suggestion
In other words the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code.,Normal
This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.,Normal
If ShowAsync() or ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.Popup) is used then the location of the dialog is not well controlled.,Normal
On the other hand if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesn't always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded.,Normal
For example an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in XAML.,Normal
(In addition per (1) above a lock of some kind is needed).,Normal
Currently when the last element(s) of the tile doesn't fit (because of users with unusual scaling settings for example) it get's discarded out of view which is understandable.,Normal

Please document how transitions work and expose the necessary API for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing APIs.,Suggestion
For example on WP if I want to use a custom transition I can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work I need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frame's collection.,Normal
At the very least we need a No Op transition that can be used to prevent the frame's stack from using the last transition to animate the page change.,Suggestion

Auto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application.,Normal
As a developer I should have access to the entire WinRT API if I am building an app for my own personal device.,Suggestion
Perhaps more developers would build for Windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions.,Suggestion
This is an excellent feature but I would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal WinJS app.,Suggestion
It would be great to use Bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the Windows project and the Windows Phone project.,Suggestion
It makes sense to disallow universal C#/Xaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target Windows 8 or only target Windows Phone.,Suggestion
Therefore there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using Bower instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects.,Normal
It would make sense i think that en (no region) language will be used as a fallback for all en countries if there is no en-region specified.,Suggestion
Please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back-end systems.,Suggestion
Also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re-purchase the app.,Suggestion
If you add more than a few like 25+ the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pins/controls are in the right position.,Normal

Pleas allow in the WMappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my WP81 app can function just as it did in WP8.,Suggestion
However there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods.,Suggestion
To set a difference a swipe to the right should launch 'settings' menu as a swipe to the left launches the 'apps list'.,Suggestion

Something in both Silverlight and WPF but missing from UWP - Tiled brushes!,Normal
(Although curiously TileBrush is still the base class for brushes... just without tiling :'( ),Normal
This will allow use of tiled images (and perhaps videos) for use as brushes anywhere a XAML Brush is accepted - like Backgrounds Text foregrounds Path fills etc.,Normal
I want my UWP UI to look the same across any screen of the same resolution regardless of the scale factor applied by Windows.,Normal
For instance when running my app on the Hololens it applies a 150% scale factor.,Normal
This means the UI looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution (1280x720).,Normal
Can this be implemented for the Hololens?,Normal
There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView.,Normal
Say you throw up a message box a la Do you want to save the changes Yes/No/Cancel if you were to click Cancel there's no way to prevent the NavigationView to follow through with it visually.,Normal
Say you have two menu items one Home and the other Whatever.,Normal
There's no sane way to do it e.g.,Normal
a Cancel boolean on the event args of the ItemInvoked event.,Normal
An example for this would be this budgeting app I'm currently working on.,Normal
If you're editing a transaction but haven't committed it trying to navigate away I'd like to throw up a Save Changes?,Normal
message box with the typical Yes/No/Cancel options.,Normal
I can't deal with the Cancel action without code voodoo trying to revert the SelectedItem ASAP.,Normal
Thanks for considering changing this.,Normal

Repository on github: https://github.com/tesar-tech/MediaPlayerFrameMoveInconsistentBehavior,Normal
At first this isn't an issue since the control isn't Visible.,Normal
However if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear.,Normal
This was probably done as a performance optimization; however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won't bind when an item is not visible in the UI.,Normal
Otherwise yet again MVVM is broken.,Normal
I have a UWP UserControl line chart that renders a PathFigure to a Canvas.,Normal
This chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area.,Normal
At high zoom levels (above 300%) the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception: An unhandled win32 exception occured in <app> [17800],Normal
There must be a bug some place in the framework.,Normal
This crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping issue was fixed.,Normal
I'm guessing it's a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack.,Normal
From my viewpoint I think there is no way in managed code I should be getting a native exception like this.,Normal
The following Hyper-V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine:,Normal
Connecting the host to a non-corporate (remote) WiFi network.,Normal

Using the fall creator's update version of UWP it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model the previous view model is updated with null values.,Normal

Changing to last UWP solve the designer problem; but the attached properties are not working (the binding) and I have to do set binding by code,Normal
While understandable that there are big challenges to overcome to make this possible but currently the bar to create optional packages is too high due that the time investment and issues that can occur makes it not that worh it due the C++ requirement.,Normal
The CreateStreamedFileAsync() method is there since Windows 8 to delay creation of file data.,Normal
However when using the result in a Drag+Drop or Clipboard operation Windows Explorer errors out with 0x80004002 No such interface supported.,Normal
It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame.,Normal
There are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily e.g.,Normal
in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP.,Normal

To clarify that this can be done from Windows 10 as a part of Windows administration and configuration for instance via Group Policies PowerShell Windows Updates Schedule Tasks etc.,Normal
There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer.,Normal
If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed.,Normal
This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data.,Normal
The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom) which used to be recommended for SSD drives.,Normal
In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case.,Normal
It also happens if the indexer isn't working properly (which is not uncommon).,Normal
If the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon) then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo).,Normal
I don't think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable.,Normal
This will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where DOM inspection is necessary.,Normal
When setting ToolTipService.Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp.,Normal

We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page--until the PasswordBox has received focus.,Normal
On a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin-scoped PasswordBox.,Normal

I think I found a problem in Media Player.,Normal
The problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app.,Normal
In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system.,Normal
But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states.,Normal
I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory.,Normal
I've looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and I'm not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesn't affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator).,Normal
Compact overlay window is always shown at the right-top corner.,Normal

Assume the following XAML: and not calling SetDesiredBounds!,Normal
This is what the screen looks like: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwcFjitFI7iNTXl5A,Normal
(sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment!),Normal
Looks good?,Normal
Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player!,Normal
In full screen transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area.,Normal
Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete.,Normal
Nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected.,Normal
So far so good.,Normal
Now let's turn on DesiredBoundsMode.,Normal
The safe area is removed... and it looks like the following: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwdhtSgx38PFkcWeQ,Normal
Page has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page.,Normal
(For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video?,Normal
That's an real issue.,Normal
I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page.,Normal
I debugged this a lot and found a solution (and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft):,Normal
In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point.,Normal
I found out that there is a <grid> element with x:name=ControlPanelGrid and on Xbox it gets magically a margin of 4804827,Normal
This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above.,Normal
Removing the x:name or renaming that element is enough the margin is gone.,Normal
Nevertheless I would expect a less hacky solution.,Normal
Having a safe-area within a media element's transport controls when not full-screen is definitely a bug.,Normal
And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it's name is not present.,Normal
The MediaPlayerElement supports various subtitle formats.,Normal
But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them.,Normal

While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every 1MB which is not really accurate.,Normal
I've noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every 250 ms.,Normal
This would allow us to easily use different ItemTemplates for each group in conjunction with GroupStyleSelector.,Normal
There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type.,Normal
imagine a image viewer where you have one group Folders and one group Images.,Normal
Or you display search results for various item types in one view.,Normal
It is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal ItemTemplateSelector on ListView/GridView.,Normal
But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones).,Normal
Plus as I read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template.,Normal
Now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control.,Normal
'm writing this feedback in Desktop Bridge because I think this team is the innovative and will do a better job of communicating these problems to Windows Store team.,Normal
Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off.,Normal
Currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names.,Normal
There are no keyword searches.,Normal
This has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it.,Normal
If you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as Desktop Bridge this is the reason.,Normal
There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team doesn't seem to listen.,Normal
Otherwise the private store can only be used for in-house apps or free apps.,Normal

Each JavaScript app that uses a Video element in the UI and calls the play() function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will Crash after recent Windows 10 update 10.0.15063.608,Normal

For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non-functional in Windows 10.,Normal
According to the documentation it is possible to x:Bind events to a handler.,Normal
When working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names.,Normal
So for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works:,Normal
This behavior is not found in public documentation.,Normal
But I couldn't find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality.,Normal
In DX11 you can't read and write to the same texture and that's fine I can live with that.,Normal
However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario.,Normal
These objects are semi-transparent (alpha-blending) so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera (back to front) and not by state changes.,Normal
Let's assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP),Normal
And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM),Normal
Both SP and TM use alpha blending.,Normal
SP don't do depth writes but they do depth-tests and depth reads in the shader.,Normal
TM do depth writes and depth tests but they don't do depth reads in the shader.,Normal
By depth writes I mean the D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask,Normal
So both SP and TM do legal operations (they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time),Normal
However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way:,Normal
I have to change the depth stencil view using OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled or disabled.,Normal
So in order to draw them all I have to do:,Normal
To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it 100 times.,Normal
And the calls to OMSetRenderTargets are really useless because the same depth texture is used just with a different view and because both SP and TM do legal operations they don't write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time.,Normal
-I don't need to create 2 depth stencil views for each depth buffer (one with D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled and one with disabled),Normal
-I don't need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH.,Normal
But I just stick to normal depth writes D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask,Normal
This artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in WebGL 2 in Chrome/FireFox:,Normal
Once you start working on WebGL 2 in MS Edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in GLES3/WebGL2 it's legal to read from the depth texture while it's bound to the FBO and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH or no.,Normal
Say I have 100 objects to draw.,Normal
SP don't do depth writes but they do depth-tests… more,Normal
See GitHub issue for more information and scenarios (https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/239),Normal

When adding (or removing) a lot of items we suspend the events and will raise a *single* event for all the items that were changed during the suspension period.,Normal
Before recent changes we were (ab)using the .Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed.,Normal
In the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows *exactly* what has changed in the suspension state.,Normal

WinAppDriver does not work with @WindowsFindBy annotation because AppiumFieldDecorator forces the GET /context command which is not supported by WinAppDriver.,Normal
I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching so /context command is not provided.,Normal
However the context switching is not required to support @WindowsFindBy annotated element.,Normal
Then Appium will happily use the native locator.,Normal
I can get the page source with current WinAppDriver and I see all the elements returned have the attributes for size (width height) or position(x y) but the values of those attribute are all zero.,Normal
I think this is the reason why Appium Inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the App Source tree or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the App Source tree.,Normal

It would be nice to see Windows Phone move to optional vector based icons instead of static bitmaps.,Suggestion
This would allow the application bar (or appbar) to resize if say HD screens were added.,Normal
"Ideally, users would only need 2 icons for the marketplace: 'Tile' (contains the application name), and 'List' (just the icon for the app list).",Normal
Appbars could be created at 48x48 and resized as needed.,Normal
"I know this is a pain on developers that are not designers or have designers, but an option would be nice time saver for the future.",Suggestion
It would be nice to be able to delete a cert you have uploaded.,Suggestion
"I'd like to be able to decorate my home screen by pinning my favorite photos, directly from within the pictures application.",Suggestion
Allow users to organize tiles into separate hubs.,Suggestion
A secondary start hub I can use to store occasionally used apps would be good.,Suggestion
An automated hub for recently used apps would also be good.,Suggestion
Please allow the access to phone filesystem.,Suggestion
It would be a great benefit if the developers can manipulate the sdcard resources etc etc.,Suggestion
"HP have the ePrint functionality, Apple the Airprint.",Normal
Can you not make connection to these devices possible?,Normal
I want to give a textbox a placeholder text.,Normal
This now requires creating a custom control.,Normal
I want this to be available out of the box.,Normal
"Oh, and I want the option to create labels for the textbox.",Normal
Provide the access to pictures in PhotoChooser and Camera Roll in emulator,Suggestion
Since the easiest way to get hold of files to be used in programs is by downloading them from a network or the internet and saving them in isolated storage it would make the whole thing a lot easier if you could do this with FTP.,Normal
FTP is still one of the most used protocols for retrieving files.,Normal
And using a proxy is not always an options since some of us would like to be able to reach FTP servers that is on a separate network.,Normal
"IMAP idle for ""push"" emails and sync read, forward and answered mails plus sync send folder!",Normal
Email for business is very impotant!,Normal
"For all the guys & girls over the 45 years old, de need a really big clock in the main display.",Normal
Thanks (sorry about my english).,Normal
Positioning cursor is almost imposible,Normal
WP should support ussd menu and umb as well,Suggestion
"Once removed the Metro interface looks good from a desktop app, but on the mobile phone is horrible.",Normal
"When the volume is in the rang 01-09, the volume does not decrease.",Normal
"Continuing my prior post about allowing us to explicitly flip secondary live tiles with a tap instead of launching the app, this request would allow such an action to explicitly update the tile by triggering a function call in a background task.",Suggestion
"Perhaps these two ideas are combined and you define which action to take when creating/updating the tile... Flip the tile, execute a background task (or both), or simply launch the app like normal (possibly with deep toast.)",Suggestion
"That would really make LiveTiles 'Live' which now, they kind of aren't and were by *far* the biggest disappointment when we saw the actual SDK.",Normal
"Coming from iOS, when we did see that, we scrapped two apps we were going to release on WP7.",Normal
"(A third was scrapped because of the inability to do location tracking in a background task more frequently than once every 30 minutes, which is sort of the same 'stale data' issue as here.)",Normal
"Since it's user-initiated, it wouldn't drain_æ_ more",Normal
"In the Schedule Namespace ist isn't possible to have access to the Media Library to play Songs, User has already on his Device -> Please add this function to get access to the Media Library.",Suggestion
"Another thing is, to have the possibility to modify the Notification, wich is shown, when the Alarm or Reminder Rings.",Suggestion
"We need to open our Application, or to overwrite the notify to costumize it to get a better improvement for the user.",Normal
"Extend the API to query phone volume and vibration settings, maybe even set them.",Suggestion
Please provide validation templates for WindowsPhone controls.,Suggestion
"However, not everybody has a physical device, so having those experiences in the emulator would be a great addition to the dev tools and resources.",Suggestion
"Would be nice and useful to have email messages grouped by date, same as contacts grouped by initial letter.",Suggestion
For sharing audio and video there should be a very plain possibility to share stuff as already encoded package.,Suggestion
Perhaps that could be available as Toolkit in codeplex.com.,Suggestion
There needs to be an Alpha Test mechanism available.,Suggestion
"Since the beta test versions I recently submitted have been waiting for certification for 9 days, there is no way for us to work together on this.",Normal
My boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner.,Normal
If the Beta program certified apps in a day then this might not be a problem.,Normal
"As it is, it is hardly usable as a beta test program since our customers also need to see the app and improvements in a timely manner.",Normal
"We need support special multitasking tasks, like VOIP and IM!",Normal
"We can't create good apps for this services without this API, looks on your Skype client, wtf??",Normal
iOS already has this API's!,Normal
"Volume on headphone, when phone rings while listening to a song, raise to max volume.",Normal

Implement Soundwave touchless api on the phone for touch free Metro.,Suggestion
Microsoft boffins showed how they can use audio via the speaker and microphone and a dopplar computation to detect gestures without touching the screen.,Normal
I want to use that on the Phone for some games.,Normal
"In the submission process, publishers should be able to check a box for apps that are made for individuals 13 or older and 18 or older.",Suggestion
"This should flag a feature in the marketplace, when an app is being downloaded, to verify the age of the downloader.",Normal
"In WP7 you can add multiple accounts of different types (Live, Google, Facebook, etc).",Normal
It would be nice to be allowed to get basic information about these accounts.,Suggestion
"For example, get a list of all email accounts and for each account report the number of unread emails.",Normal
I think there are two ways to improve the beta program: 1.,Normal
Make apps available immediately.,Suggestion
"When developing on iOS (using testflight) or Android, we don't have to wait two hours for beta code to be ""approved"".",Normal
We upload a new version or have the users download an update immediately.,Normal
"If immediate approval is not possible, then apps that have been published should be immediately available.",Suggestion
"When we receive emails saying the beta application is published, users are not able to download the application with the very own links provided in the email.",Normal
Users are reporting a 1-2 day time between when the app is approved to when it is available for download.,Normal
Users receive a strange marketplace error when trying to download the application.,Normal
When developing apps it is often useful to leverage existing Launchers and Choosers as Tasks to access certain data or perform an operation.,Normal
Currently this is only exposed for system-level data and operations.,Normal
It would be ideal to allow apps to expose certain bits of data or functionality to other apps to provide a complementary experience in terms of reuse of information or performing similar tasks.,Suggestion
Imagine shopping apps being able to share a set of data such as a wish list or news apps being able to share a list of news feeds.,Normal
"Imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app, such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data.",Normal
It would be the responsibility of the app to decide what it exposes for data or functionality.,Normal
This can first be alleviated as with other security screening by prompting the user to allow an app to access another app's tasking features.,Suggestion
"In such case, you'd better make your videos carefully so that it can leave a good user experience to the potential clients.",Suggestion
"If you convert video to FLV flash video, which features much smaller size than popular formats, your videos will be watched unhinderedly with quick loading.",Suggestion
select FLV as output format,Normal
"If you are more requirements of your video, such as bit rate, encoder, etc, you are do these settings one by one in the pop-up Formats window.",Normal
" When everything is finished, you can click Start button to start the video to FLV conversion process.",Normal
You are allowed to preview the converting process in slideshow.,Normal
"As 99% computer owners have installed flash plugin in web browser, so it's naturally that FLV or SWF flash videos are more acceptable than popular videos formats, such as MP4, AVI, MPEG or ect.",Normal
"If you convert video to FLV flash video, which features much smaller size than_æ_ more",Normal
Allow the BackgroundAudioPlayer to play tracks from the MediaLibrary.,Suggestion
Or allow applications that implement the XNA MediaPlayer class to run in the background.,Suggestion
"Please add the possibility to add your own spell check service, or provide the data if a system wide one existed.",Suggestion
"When I want to build some tiles in my app, I have to use buttons that I give a custom style.",Normal
"But this is ugly since everyone implements this in another way, resulting in odd alignments, bad text colours, etc.",Normal
We need a simple and standardized way to create simple tiles that function as buttons.,Suggestion
Beta testers test our apps for free.,Normal
It would be nice if when the app/game is published in the marketplace we could include a list of the testers that helped us so they can get the app from free instead of having to buy it.,Suggestion
"Android,iOs and Blackberry are compatible with this API So why don't we",Suggestion

Visual Studio 11 and new Expression Blend.,Normal
Merge products together.,Suggestion
"Add 'open app in marketplace' in the app menu (rate & review, uninstall, pin to start)",Suggestion
It does not look professional when scrolling upward at the end of any page or downward at the top the content of the page regardless of material or application will be stretched down,Normal
It is part of the effect through the whole operating system and does not particularly belong to any application.,Normal
Sometime the stretched content of the page does not look professional.,Normal

We want an Office Hub that open Openoffice document.,Suggestion
Currently for dynamic data binding controlls like listbox  is recommended.,Suggestion
Why can't I change phone search and IE search to Google or another provider that actually work?,Suggestion
Fix Bing or fix the phone.,Suggestion
"At best this is unclear, but should the user pan or zoom they lose the frame of reference for the place we're trying ot show them.",Normal
You can sometimes work around this behaviour by specifying a search for the place you're trying to indicate but this is dependent upon the search results.,Normal
If the search finds nothing you get no pin.,Normal
Or if the search finds something other than what you intended you can end up with a pin (or pins) far from where you want them.,Normal
If it were possible to tell the task to show a pin (or pins) at a specific point (or points) that that would allow for a better user experience.,Suggestion
Even if we could just specify a label for the pin that would be better than nothing.,Suggestion
"Add an option ""Private"" to lock photos, movies, songs, calendar appointments...",Suggestion
An exit button should be there on all application software's.,Suggestion
"Show used volume, so you can see how much MB of your inclusive volume is already used.",Suggestion

"Allowing for tester groups or ""profiles"" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially for multiple products, by allowing a group to be assigned to the app as it is entered in the Marketplace as a beta.",Suggestion
"Additionally, it would be great to have additional support for Enterprise developers that target a specific set of clients as opposed to the public masses of the Marketplace.",Suggestion
"First, an Enterprise Developer account could be established with a cost of, say $499, which is high enough to deter hobbyists or smaller companies from enrolling, while at the same time providing additional benefits to larger ""enterprise-level"" corporations.",Suggestion
"Ideally, a mini storefront or splash page for the company and product would help draw in clients.",Suggestion
"Allowing for tester groups or ""profiles"" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially_æ_ more",Suggestion
"If the app shows sensitive data when deativated, it would be good to be able to use a different image for fast app switching instead of a screenshot of the application",Suggestion
"Daemon service should be turnable on and off per app basis, in the same way like periodic tasks.",Suggestion
Microsoft should advertise windows phone development APIs in Visual Studio,Suggestion
"Please make it instead fire an event, which could be used to open an app's search bar or page.",Suggestion
At least support displaying static GIF image.,Suggestion
"Back and forward buttons needed, not the capacitive back button.",Suggestion
Please consider to enable support for unsafe code in Silverlight and Xna apps.,Suggestion
Maximizing all current main apps would be better than having 1mil appd in the marketplace.,Suggestion
Create option to allow Periodic Agents to run even if app has not been opened for x days.,Suggestion

"On an Xbox, we can log in and play games no problem, yet a W7 phone allows for only one user.",Normal

"Secondly, you need to limit the number of apps that a publisher can submit with a particular key word.",Suggestion
"We should have some way within our app to get notify that whether user selected call, don't call and when he/she ended call means notification of end call.",Suggestion
"It would be more useful if specific Service apps could be released that would extend these features by, for example, adding a Google+ option to the sharing interface.",Suggestion
"Would be nice if in power point, could have same method as in pictures hub for navigation.",Suggestion
"Received from an MVP this week over email: It would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the NMEA file format - either via file import/export, or using the files directly as a feed.",Suggestion
Other devices use this format and it would be great to see it supported by Windows Phone.,Suggestion
they all use Sip so it would be great to have a native sip client integrated.,Suggestion
Also a T9 keyboard would be nice too.,Suggestion
I want to be able to add a picture to the media library and then start the SharePictureTask to let the user see and share it from the Pictures Hub,Suggestion

"Minimally it should show the CN from the subject which matches the service name you provide in client code, along with the CN of the signer.",Suggestion
Ideally it would allow you to download the certificate for verification or at least provide a md5 hash of the uploaded certificate.,Normal
Right now you can upload an unsupported certificate or even self-signed cert and apphub will not provide any feedback.,Normal

"If the keyboard is not installed, nothing changes and the current layout remain.",Normal
"Please implement this, it is important for me for a translation application.",Normal
"I suggest to create hardware ratings, like ones in Winows 7 (WEI), for the smartphone in order to help both users and developers to match hardware with apps or games.",Suggestion
I think that this ratings will even enable developers to create different versions of the same app pointing to specific hardware.,Normal
It would be nice to be able to use the computer keyboard when using the emulator.,Suggestion

"because push notifications can easily go unnoticeable, there should be a history in the ""me"" tile that will also tell you if you missed something.",Suggestion
Tile counts are nice but I dont have every app pinned nor do I want it that way.,Normal
Just a history for one days notifications would be enough.,Normal
"It would be really nice to have a ""Share"" task that I could pass a stream to, in order to share an image.",Suggestion
This task could bring up the same interface when I share an photo from my pictures library.,Normal

i have about 30 apps and it is already difficult to find an app ...i think the jumplist shuld be always available.,Suggestion
I believe scrolling should be improved.,Normal
"As sometimes when users are viewing a long document, they sometimes might want to skip to the middle/lower section.",Normal

it will encourage a developer to design better apps and it makes very easy for customers to choose the right apps ibstead of selectibg some poorly designed apps and wasting the time..,Normal
I see many developers can be benefited from text2speech api.,Suggestion
It can also bring in whole range of new apps for windows phone.,Normal
"In Android For C2DM , Google is providing free account and restrict number of messages per day.",Normal
Supporting Windows Authentication could be very usefull for example writing app that interacts with Microsoft Dynamics CRM,Suggestion
currently only a defined set of extensions are supported for files to upload to SkyDrive using the new live API which limit really the usage of the API.,Normal

The only way this would really work well is if it ran in the background like the phone's native phone functionality.,Normal
If there is an app developer the a customer lukes i'd be good to see everything that they have made.,Suggestion
"Full (or almost) Entity Framework support, including graphic class designer and interop with regular EF assemblies, making it easy for developers to reuse model and persistence classes in the phone, without the need to redo all the work in Linq and some nasty tricks.",Normal
It would be nice to have the Deployment ability on my home PC able to be done wirelessly.,Suggestion
"This includes deploying in Visual Studio while developing, and using the Application Deployment Tool that is installed w/ the dev tools.",Normal

"This could be implemented via WiFi, of course (since Zune does wireless Sync already), or even Bluetooth once we get Bluetooth data transfer ability.",Normal
Wp7.5 lacks USB audio functionality with Microsoft Sync in cars.,Normal
Bluetooth playing audio is very limited.,Normal
Requesting MTP and mass storage functionality since competitors like iPhone are able to do all this already with Sync.,Suggestion

too slow and too little possibilities,Normal
I took a while until I realized that I forgot {StaticResource} within the Style attribute...,Normal

SplashScreenImageLight and SplashScreenImageDark would be great!,Suggestion
"After that, it would be great to have the option to select an image from IsolatedStorage so that my app can update its splash screen image as needed.",Suggestion
Make it so that a meteo style app would only need to adapt its UI to run on Windows phone.,Suggestion
It would also be nice to have to deploy only one package to the marketplace but only the needed bits would be tranfered.,Suggestion
Add movies and books would be an excellent addition for the system !,Suggestion
"Enable Speech Command to play songs selection by saying ""play song name"", ""play artist"", ""play album"".",Suggestion
I believe the single most important thing for Windows Phone to be successful is that users in all countries should have the same services available.,Suggestion
Now when the marketplace has become available it would be great if users in other countries than US could migrate their accounts to the country they really live in.,Suggestion
"Since windows phones are selling hot in countries like India, browser should start displaying Indian language characters.",Suggestion
Allow user to set different accent colors for different tiles.,Suggestion
"we should have small tiles instead of a long list of apps of which you downloaded, like android and ios.",Suggestion
An app should be able to publish a service that is disvoerable and consumable by other apps.,Suggestion
"For example, if I have an app that can process images, I want other apps to be able to dicover my app and submit photos for me to process.",Suggestion
I would like access to a stream for music played via the media library.,Suggestion
"i wish the functionality to access and synchronize the public folder from exchange, e.g. the public contacts or the calendar.",Suggestion
This would enable live traffic aware apps.,Normal
Please try other formatting like bold italics shadow to distinguish titles/subtitles from content.,Suggestion
Since computers were invented to save time I suggest we be allowed to upload them all in one zip file - using numbering for the file names and the portal could place them in the right order.,Suggestion
Allow rearranging if the user wants to change them!,Suggestion
Add SIMD instructions for better use of ARM NEON instructions for math and games.,Suggestion
Also using a hot swapping code generator (optimized machine code like HotSpot in Java does) would also be very helpful to mitigate slow C# code.,Suggestion
Microsoft should seriously look into getting rid of Symantec for all these payment stuff.,Suggestion
I would be extremely useful in a variety of app types to be notified upon call started and ended events at least be able to check whether or not the device is being used for a phonecall.,Suggestion
I would like to see informatin about the certification process in the dev center app.,Suggestion
It would be nice to see at a glance if an app is featured in one of the markets .,Suggestion
Also I would be fun to have a record showing the featured markets and dates.,Suggestion
Make ProgressRing control available for Windows Phone just like Win8.,Suggestion
It would be great if the OS moved on to the second third etc NFC record and tried to trigger off of them until there was a success.,Suggestion
We need for our applications on each of the mobile platforms to be able to read data on a separate NDEF records contained in an NDEF message.,Suggestion
Provide Process Class/APIs (like that for regular Windows) to develop lower level operations like Task Manager in Windows,Suggestion
Please add the possibility the set price (& market distribution) and trial mode existence individually for the XAPs.,Suggestion
Add the ability to do memory profiling on background agent (periodic) as they are limited on memory and sometimes its too hard to catch memory leaks.,Normal

Please expose ETW logging namespaces like System.Diagnostics.Eventing so that it is possible to log events from the windows 8 app.,Suggestion
Currently the only way to take advantage of the direct manipulation in a XAML Windows store app is by using a ScrollViewer.,Normal
Instead of having a top charts style listing where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere create a new form of distribution where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace.,Suggestion
Highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles.,Suggestion
It seems to me that all good apps/games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts and waiting to be featured just isn't worth it.,Suggestion
Maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it.,Suggestion
It would be great to be able to use the WP8 emulator (and Surface emulator for that matter) for mobility demonstrations i.e. when I deliver a Dynamics CRM demo I often (nearly always) want to include mobility scenarios on the same screen as the rest of the demo.,Suggestion
It will even allow seamless migration to new hardware.,Normal
I would like to ask Microsoft to give us a tool(option in emulator) with which we can take screenshots once in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app.,Suggestion
You have to run one emulator take screenshots close it and run another and so on.,Normal
SharpDX proves that those key technologies can be made available to CSharp: I would suggest to either support the project or to provide your own interface.,Suggestion
It would be more natural to allow the physical search key to activate the search function on the active application rather than loading Bing which is rarely the goal.,Suggestion
Associate bound objects to data templates implicitly by type instead of explicitly by template name.,Suggestion
For more information see Data Binding.,Normal
On WP8 add optional support to hook these hardware keys press events for the lens (plug-in) features...hardware keys should include vol+ vol- stage 1 (light press) camera shutter stage 2 (deep press) camera shutter.,Suggestion
"When an application has problems or when a problem is detected in advance by the developer until the publication of the correction version the client is without knowing what is happening, it would be possible for Microsoft to implement a communications resource developer for customers who have installed its application?",Suggestion
Read/write accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles (based on week-days time position etc).,Suggestion
It s impossible to connect easily to ftp network I suggest to include it in the future sdk.,Suggestion
I hope Microsoft can open Asia voice function fastest,Suggestion
We need support special multitasking tasks like VOIP and IM!,Suggestion
Please add the possibility to add your own spell check service or provide the data if a system wide one existed.,Suggestion
If Microsoft created some incentives like a free device (Blackberry did this) and a free year of membership (Amazon did this) it could drive a lot of developers to the platform which is crucial to the platform taking off.,Suggestion
I would be a really nice gesture to have an option wich can put everything to the other side so when left handed people scroll they could also see the content.,Suggestion
It would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the NMEA file format - either via file import/export or using the files directly as a feed.,Suggestion
currently you can only pin an album but it would be useful if you can pin a single image as a tile.. that way you have easy access to a it.,Suggestion
why shouldn't I as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries?,Suggestion
For apps that synchronize or connect to networks sporadically it would be handy to have an easy way to detect if you are on a cheap connection so if WiFi is connected or the device is connected to the web via USB.,Suggestion
So suggestion is to add properties like “IsWiFiConnected” and “IsCableConnected” to DeviceNetworkInformation that execute fast.,Suggestion
Give developers good explanation what they do wrong and enforce good design.,Suggestion
Apps should take no longer than 2-3 seconds to start and need to explain why they would take longer.,Suggestion
Please provide APIs for call forwarding and other call management functions(hold/unholdswapconferenceetc),Suggestion
As a user I would like to be able to select songs that I have put on the device (from my library) to wake up to.,Suggestion
Thus this idea is actually for the developers to make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll like every 5 scrolls the scrolling speed will increase..,Suggestion
in addition the user should be able to take a scree shot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are completly green a photograph noise will occur allow with a sudden screen flare to tell the user the screen shot has been taken and saved in the saved images folder,Suggestion
We need the ability for developers to add relevant tags to their app descriptions we then need the ability to search for apps with those tags tags should also be verified during app submission to ensure theyre relevant,Suggestion
It will be pleasant to go the main page of the app in the marketplace to see the general présentation screenshots & the other users reviews,Suggestion
Allow user to send Video Audio and more pictures in an MMS now only one pic is supported,Suggestion
Allow access to raw data such as signal strength imformation to allow creation of indoor location positioning using available wifi bluetooth or cellular networks when no gps data is available.,Suggestion
Since windows phones are selling hot in countries like India browser should start displaying Indian language characters.,Suggestion
And a smart dialer can then be a full alternative to the built-in phone app since the app also can have a quick-button for goto the regular phone app whenever the user wants to do that.,Suggestion
As an alternative to giving write-access to calendar (which can be hard to get a go on for security reasons) let us at least open an appointment directly in the calendar app.,Suggestion
Signal strength directly impacts video playback experience.,Normal
But reusing the operating system component saves us development effort and ensures it looks as expected as the operating system evolves.,Normal
You can ask for a request but it's not clear what and when something will happen.,Normal
With windows u have the UI app and the service app hosted locally  may be the IIS express used during local debug can be used.,Normal
This new approach of developing applicaitons simlifies the UI development  where developer get rid of learning other technologies like java scriptangularjquerystyle sheets and all those n number of scripts.,Normal
Typical problem here would be deployment(Installationupdate) of the UI application to client machine But if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the UI app should be only one obfuscated executable file It should not depend on reference… more,Normal
Bonus points for it to be xaml standard compliant,Normal
In addition this will allow a greater prominence of XAML Standard and greater acceptance in the market and in the media.,Normal
Don't require developers to use the background task builder and background triggers just to activate an app in the background.,Normal
A control that offers hour minute & second selection would be helpful.,Normal
Add to CollectionViewSource function pointer to get the group objects not just PropertyPath,Normal
A DatePickerFlyout whose Date is two-way bound will update target-to-source but not source-to-target.,Normal
When functions and FallbackValue is used in an x:bind at same time the parameter must match exactly.,Normal
Playback seamlessly between one media and another,Normal
A control for visualizing and editing networks graphs and flow-charts,Normal
Leave them alone!),Normal
Does not make sense that an Idle task would be suspended for not being busy enough.,Normal
Making the task more busy (to work around idle tasks being suspended) would mean more battery usage kind of the opposite of what you want.,Normal
Microsoft wants us to build more connected app with Project Rome API.,Normal
In 15063 we can extend brush (by XamlCompositionBrushBase).,Normal
It also annoys during development because now my solution has to have 4 target platforms while it could just have one.,Normal
What I want is to drag and drop a file then be able to get its full path and file name as stored on the disk and access it using standard C++ IO file access functions such as fopen fread etc.,Normal
I don't want to use XAML because: it looks complicated it looks like it can reduce performance I'm making 3D heavy DirectX based applications that need full performance.,Normal
For example I drag and drop a BMP image my app compresses it and saves as PNG image automatically in the same folder with the same name.,Normal
Dual screen + Google Card Glass fulfill the function and make the application very attractive.,Normal
We wanna to commuicate other App in Desktop.,Normal
not only other UWP but WPF application.,Normal
I've done the same tests in UWP mode using DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD and results were the same slow as in Win32/WinAPI.,Normal
From what I see ASTC would be great for that have good quality but also small size looks like it has lot of format options so I could choose what I want.,Normal
I'm pretty sure the new TreeView is not Fall Creators Update dependent.,Normal
Map became unusable after phone 10.0.15063 update.,Normal
ResolveCompleted event comes after ten seconds.,Normal
d) Lines on traffic layer are blurred jagged and looking bad.,Normal
While nice looking UWP UI is not well suited for creating UI-heavy classic applications (think VisualStudio/AutoCAD/Blender/LOBs with a lot of data) that you would never want to use on tablet/phone.,Normal
If our - ISV - UWP App also have this feature we can spent more time to trying the new feature and Insider customer and testers can use it and we could got feedbacks.,Normal
Because if you currently assign a Binding a VisualState setter as below it will resolve the value of the binding and assign that to the target while you would like to assign the binding itself.,Normal
This will allow designs and implementations to change bindings depending on states and even help some states where some bindings are not required to be temporarily set to x:Null for performance (handy in complex screens).,Normal
We can see the entries added in the registry but client cannot access the interfaces.,Normal
For example lets say I want to create shorthand for aligning a control inside RelativePanel fully horizontal like AlignHorizontalWithPanel.,Normal
Allows desktop apps to incrementally adopt UI innovations and creates a bridge to UWP for app UI.,Normal
I tried the converted app using IME.,Normal
We want to improve support Google IME.,Normal
I thinks it's not difficult to do since Cortana for PC supports up to 13 languages as listed on https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/557b5e0e-0eb0-44db-87d6-5e5db6f9c5b0/cortana-s-regions-and-languages,Normal
You can verify this with the CameraStreamCorrelation sample.,Normal
The following streams are available on the PC:,Normal
The following streams are available on the XBOX:,Normal
Are there any plans to support skeleton tracking on the XBOX?,Normal
It seems such a shame that the new Kinect drivers expose the Kinect via this API and yet the ExposureControl is marked as being not supported for the Kinect.,Normal
From the libfreenect2 library it seems entirely possible to tell the Kinect not to do auto-exposure.,Normal
I expect that the content set directly (the text) to persist after closing the application.,Normal
To me something that may cause a runtime crash (and that the compiler clearly knows to flag) should not a warning but an error.,Normal
xbox dev mode companion work ipv6 please...,Normal
"Make it really smooth to update code of a UWP app,  like you are already doing with the XAML part the app is automatically reloaded without being shut down and relaunched.",Suggestion
A XAML designer for Visual Studio in Windows 7.,Normal
The control would allow for the use of the contact picker but allows for manual entry and deletion of contacts.,Normal
To give the user a sense of consistency the file picker remembers the last location that the user navigated to and will generally start at that location.,Normal
This is not always the best solution for example pretend you had a UWP app that asked the user to select a picture and a music file.,Normal
I am migrating my app from Windows Desktop using Core Audio API to UWP using hopefully AudioGraph.,Normal
We are exploring moving forward with UWP but currently there is no way to access the pipeline to add custom shaders and models like we do now in Virtual Earth with Microsoft.MapPoint.Graphics3D.GraphicsEngine3D and Microsoft.MapPoint.Rendering3D.Scene.Step.,Normal
I'm developing a Java application so interop with C# is kinda tricky while interop Shell32 API or C libraries is pretty easy and straightforward with JNA.,Normal
It is very difficult to Create a Custom RichEditBox with all the basic features Like Text Formatting Bullets and numbering Support for Inking Like OneNote and also to support adaptive layout that's too much work for basic Text editing.,Normal
I'm creating app using face detection.,Normal
If we put the MKV in another service or server the video is reproduced but the connection with OneDrive has been lost.,Normal
It stops on the way.,Normal
Chinese and Italian support have already been asked for.,Normal
In some cases an access error may occur at the time of opening a file or it may be opened correctly.,Normal
We want a solution.,Normal
Something seems to have changed with loggingchannel possibly default manifest code that handles the string message has changed around 15043?,Normal
FWIW preview versions of windows post anniversary update were showing the message correctly.,Normal
I'd like to have implicit DataTemplates in UWP.,Normal
Currently i can only input plain text in toast notification <input> since the type does not support password.,Normal
Developers need to have good and deep understanding of how UI virtualization works on UWP app,Normal
Currently you can use the Pivot or there are 3rd-party vendors providing a TabControl.,Normal
I'm converting some wpf apps to uwp and I'm missing a report control.,Normal
Please open up the base classes for inheritance and provide a sample how to create a custom virtualizing panel.,Suggestion
Without this UWP is more or less a toy because any customization requires that the app be deployed completely separately.,Normal
This is only relevant for desktop UWP apps.,Normal
You can at least provide any of these solutions.,Normal
I'd use this for my media phone playing Groove 24/7.,Normal
The panorama control is still the best control for my app and my users love it.,Normal
Updating the app to UWP is not possible without this control.,Normal
Currently there is no way to prevent MenuFlyout from closing when user click any of its items.,Normal

Support I/O transactions on UWP platform as part of Windows Runtime API for file I/O,Suggestion
For example three quick touch strokes to scroll immediately to the top or bottom.,Normal
Really long lists and views are boring to scroll even at maximum scroll speed.,Normal
Keyboard have Home/End keys to scroll to top/bottom but touch screen doesn't have same capability.,Normal
But this library is fairly low-level.,Normal
That concept is painfully evident when using Microsoft's Edge browser and you want to browse various Favorites menus.,Normal
Specifically excellent mouse support means that menus will support all the hover actions that menus currently enjoy in win32 applications.,Normal
The current situation requires two mouse clicks to accomplish the same thing as a simple hover should.,Normal
I don’t know what the component should look like.,Normal
It can happen that sometimes we do need a control to store a list of pages/elements that looks like a Pivot control but with a infinite list of pages/elements.,Normal
So I tried to find other ways such as Excel Access or SQL Server Compact Edition.,Normal
So application would request secret API keys as needed from system-provided secure storage.,Normal
Release appx shouldn't have secret keys inside and keys should be on Windows Store server and those keys would be requested from server on application install.,Normal
Another advantage is the developer already have a preview in design mode,Normal
The idea would be to have a Try button on every sample.,Normal

Evidently the MediaComposition.SaveAsync() API internally uses the StorageApplicationPermissions.FutureAccessLists API which has a limitation of 1000 items.,Normal
If you add more than 1000 clips created via MediaClip.CreateFromImageFileAsync() the API will fail with this exception:,Normal
An item must be removed before another item is added.,Normal
Additional information: The maximum number of items for the access list has been reached.,Normal
In case app is installed in SD card and notification uses custom audio file default notification sound is played instead of custom audio file.,Normal

According to the documentation the proper way to handle input in a store app is to create a CoreIndependentInputSource from another thread by calling swapChainPanel.CreateCoreIndependentInputSource().,Normal

Having an API allowing getting the color of the pixels under a pointer (eventually throttled/async and only when having pointer capture on) would increase the expressiveness of the creation tools in UWP applications.,Suggestion
I am manually having to keep a list of these when it would be easily managed in the Dashboard if the status properly reflected this.,Normal
The current status only seems to show ‘In Progress’ if the app has never been put in the store before.,Normal
Meanwhile the perf counters are difficult to associate with a specific application requiring the request queue be named (which HttpListener does not do) and netsh called to find URL group IDs to use for correlation.,Normal
I did a research on AudioFrameOutputNode It is strange that it often generate AudioFrame without any audio data the AudioFrame's Duration property is 0 miliseconds but the RelativeTime property is not.,Normal
For example a user send us a feedback to ask a Windows 8.1 RT version of our app but now we are focused on Windows 10 so we need to be clear that we read his feedback but it's not on our roadmap.,Normal
After that the Age Rating questionnaires stop submitting when you press submit.,Normal
An example of this An application as a node in an internal media network would be something along the lines of AudioBus for iOS.,Normal
Extrapolate the above capabilities to Audio allowing on-the-fly add/remove interconnectable/reroutable audio nodes (virtual interface devices) to which Apps/Devices would attach to instead of attaching only to hardware interfaces.,Normal
Same for video not only making (desktop/window) screen capture a breeze and naturally handle by the OS it would also allow the creation of virtual screens (resource permitting of course for desktop expansion/mirroring) outputting them to a video input/recording apps USB3 or even to a DLNA receiver screens.,Normal
This would allow the user through the OS to detach an App media output from its default interface (audio/midi card screen/window) and re-attach it to another App (or device) input.,Normal
What if we will exchange apps reviews?,Normal
I like the ease of the app and recommend this app to all.,Normal
I have largely ignored this is the past because it was minimal but someone is finding good success with it so they're hammering everyone.,Normal
Personally I'm getting 2-3 a day from different source email addresses.,Normal
Removing the support email from the webpage would not hinder the user as they can see it via the Windows Store app.,Normal
1) A user is at lunch viewing their sensitive documents.,Normal
They switch to their Email app - our application detects active state change and auto logs out.,Normal
They finish their food and leave but forget their phone on the table.,Normal
*At this point a perpetrator is able to take the phone open the recent apps section and now can see whatever our client was looking at.,Normal
2) User is at their desktop observing files gets up and makes the app inactive (minimizes or moves to back).,Normal
We begin a timer to auto log out.,Normal
* A perpetrator is able to hover over the taskbar item and see the last screen drawn whether or not the user logged out.,Normal
Sorry if I sound bitter but I must say it's very frustrating developing for w10 mobile at the moment even if the you get good reviews the chance of them being displayed in the store is very slim due to the version fragmentation.,Normal
As I understand it insider reviews that aren't on the slow ring are removed even worse they're deleted permanently from even the Developer Dashboard.,Normal
People took time to write thoughtful reviews and they're simply deleted.,Normal
I've started to continually download review reports to just have a record of them,Normal
I've had over fifty 4+ star reviews simply disappear never to be seen again.,Normal
I see the point that insiders shouldn't bring down the ratings of the app if the OS is to blame.... but with so few people rating anyway and most people being on the fast insider ring it makes it extremely hard to get reviews.,Normal
Old Windows Phone 8.1 retain their status of being the most highly rated just because of this.,Normal
What's the point of having a rule if that means there's too few reviews and no point for most people to post reviews at all?,Normal
I'm not quite sure what a good solution is you cold allow only 3+ reviews for fast insiders but I guess that might skew reviews too positively.,Normal
Or why not let the text review stand even if the rating doesn't count?,Normal
As it is getting an accurately impressions of apps through reviews doesn't seem feasible.,Normal
The caller does not have the required permission to perform this operation.,Normal
IoT introduced the Windows.System.ProcessLauncher for starting arbitrary programs (like Process.Start in .NET).,Normal
Note when executed DNS Client service crashes,Normal
Comment out the TextAttributes line and note service does not crash,Normal
I have bound the IsPaneOpen of my SplitView to a property in my ViewModel.,Normal
This works nicely except when the SplitView is in Overlay mode and the user presses a hardware back button on the phone.,Normal
In this case the SplitViewPane gets closed as expected but it does that by seemingly overwriting the Binding on IsPaneOpen and instead setting it directly to the value false.,Normal
The effect is that the panel can never be opened again as my code will do this by setting the VM property to true but the binding was already lost.,Normal
In practical terms you are forced to make a UI technology diversion to implement new functionality.,Normal
Xaml doesn't look a tempting option because not useful for mobile or web and needed controls usually implemented in javascript first,Normal
At a application architectural level porting WinForms to HTML/JS favours an entirely new application which follows an understood/accepted architectural pattern then re-implement old functionality.,Normal
So imagine the app in question was one written by an ex-employee in 2008 in VB.Net with deep domain-knowledge targeting users with similar domain knowledge for a specialist task with no design documentation beyond a description of a manual process it replaced.,Normal
Well this is the norm... and for all it's wrong's its there.,Normal
Never had budget assigned in the first place and it's used by 10 people who are all busy.,Normal
Given the architectural barrier is the killler I don't believe there is any feature of GDI+ which cannot be expressed in HTML.,Normal
the UI may not adhere to good gui design principals it's performance may suck but it probably won't.,Normal
But it's users can start it and it will look and act the same as it did before arcane controls and all.,Normal
The architecture of a Modern HTML5 appliication has much more in common with GDI+ and a windows message loop than it does with Xaml.,Normal
Things like Redux essentially go out of their way to be like a message loop to avoid race conditions through async operations.,Normal
For Microsoft this would I believe solve a massive developer stumbling block even allowing Winforms controls to potentially be integrated in HTML UI's.,Normal
So imagine the app in question was one written by an… more,Normal
Microsoft finally developed a library able to handle NFC devices.,Normal
Unfortunately the library is only able to get the NDEF messages and doesn't give the UID of the card!,Normal
Is there a reason why this UID is not saved in the Proximity-Device once the NFC card is read?,Normal
But it has no similar property on UWP's api.,Normal
You reproduce this on Mobile Build 14393 system.,Normal
Currently there is no way to attach debugger to already running process via 'Attach to process' on mobile.,Normal
And sometimes bad bugs like deadlocks happens.,Normal
And its real pain to investigate them since usually they happen without debugger and on release builds.,Normal
Windows 10 Mobile is like back box you can't get full access to.,Normal
Frankly speaking I'm surprised that it was not there from the very beginning.,Normal
All that happens without any real user attendance which makes those triggers useless.,Normal
In WM5/6 there was an UNATTENDED power state for that situation and there was a way to detect real user interaction with the device.,Normal
Current behavior of SystemTrigger.UserAway and UserPresent is unexpected.,Normal

This is my personal favourite: mobile - file open picker - the app suspends but it cannot be debugged.,Normal
All sorts of surprises can happen with a complex app.,Normal
Before UWP CurrentCulture reflected the Regional Settings format and CurrentUICulture reflected the Display Language.,Normal
We shouln't have to relly on workaround like this one: https://www.pedrolamas.com/2015/11/02/cultureinfo-changes-in-uwp/,Normal
It would be a lot like Facebook Messenger's chat heads.,Normal

In the following MSDN Magazine Article it is mentioned that there are some limits for Voice Command Deffiniton files.,Normal
I use Windows SAPI quite intensively for an application I have built and many Grammars are easily much bigger than the limits imposed by Cortana.,Normal
This makes it a bit tricky to port the recognition engine part of the application away from SAPI and towards Cortana since SAPI provides more powerful capabilities for larger sets of commands.,Normal
Unfortunately I am not going to know all uri's the cookies are in without tracking every single domain visited (which is what I currently have to do).,Normal

An API that would take 5 minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding is,Normal
Or secondary to that a DeleteAllCookies() or ClearCookies() API as that is the only reason I need to get all of them and I can't think of any other use cases to retrieve all cookies.,Normal

Currently when using a ControlChannelTrigger with HttpClient you cannot send a HTTPS request without the application getting terminated by the system.,Normal
I tested using HTTPS and to my surprise it does work with the debugger attached no exceptions get thrown so it is implemented.,Normal
However termination occurs when the application is NOT connected to the debugger.,Normal
AudioGraph created with custom DesiredSamplesPerQuantum ignores it and uses default 10ms quantum.,Normal
Depending on hardware you may hear gaps right after start or you may need load CPU with some additional work like scrolling UI or running some work in background threads.,Normal
I guess it is result of extremely short quantum size (10ms; even switching between threads could take more time) and too low buffer length (2 quants) but it could be just some synchronization issue.,Normal
slider renders to extreme right (value 100) instead of zero,Normal
I have an app where I use a custom title bar by extending my view into the title bar area:,Normal
Then I also use code like this to allow a custom element to support dragging of the window:,Normal
This all was implemented pre-Anniversary Update.,Normal
While all this works fine a bug was introduced in the Anniversary Update where the title bar returns zero for Height SystemOverlayRightInset and SystemOverlayLeftInset now.,Normal
I confirmed that in pre-Anniversary Update these properties would return values like 32 for Height and 188 for SystemOverlayRightInset.,Normal
The use of the file type filter makes no sense when you are picking a folder and it's not menioned in the documentation,Normal
Suppose we have an app with two modes like Zune - normal and mini.,Normal
In the mini mode the app only presents the indispensable and small elements on the window.,Normal
I know maybe it's not at the Microsoft's priority list but I believe we can somehow make it available.,Normal
But that would be nice.,Normal
We do like to build universal Windows apps.,Normal
At the moment it is possible to install to the application install directory but the files there cannot be altered by the application.,Normal
If the application copies the files to the application data folder after installation as done in my work around it cannot delete the original files in the installation folder by this having two versions.,Normal
After the anniversary update the store shows default the ratings of Current version.,Normal
This is very annoying for developers of good and populair apps.,Normal
A potential user viewing in the store will most likely make his judgement to download based on the number of reviews and quality of reviews (especially since the windows store does not show the total number of downloads).,Normal
So for app publishers this will be a reason to keep app updates to an absolute minimum in order to get as many ratings as possible.,Normal
Or at least Last 30 days.,Normal
I want to know it to make custom title bar that looks exactly as defult one except with my controls.,Normal
I'm able to get SystemAccentBrush but I can't get actual window title bar's color becouse it depends on this Show accent color setting.,Normal
I've already asked the forum (where you can find the detailed description on the issue),Normal
If often mis-classify the direction.,Normal
p.s I didn't know where to post this but since the library is in Windows.Media.Ocr namespace i put it under media,Normal
Using Resources in a DataTemplate worked just fine before.,Normal
Now that I've upgraded to Anniversary and installed the newest SDK and Tools + the newest Visual Studio Update it doesn't work as expected at all.,Normal
This will crash on instantiation because somehow the ViewModel object is null when the Bindings are updated which was definitely not the case in previous versions and surely not the expected behavior.,Normal
If I replace the x:Bind with a Binding it will run but if using the datatemplate for multiple objects for example in a GridView the resource will have the same value for all instances which makes it really pointless.,Normal
Some apps have such poor startup perf that ngen is must.,Normal
Or since this is a store app will the standard background ngen work for WPF apps?,Normal
I do not like the recent change in the Dev Center.,Normal
First of all it shows cumulative acquisitions rather than for a specified amount of time making it hard to compare which apps people like more (if an app has been available longer of course the cumulative acquisitions will be higher!).,Normal
Also being able to see only some of the apps at the same time is very frustrating.,Normal
Currently it is part of a sample.,Normal
As simple as ClickOnce publishing.,Normal
I do not want to convert MSIs,Normal
Right now the new DevCenter offers the ability to sort by apps by Included Markets Base-price and Last modified.,Normal
I can see it when I go to definition on SerialDevice.,Normal
In order to break my code's dependency on actual hardware so I could automate my tests I had to reinvent the wheel.,Normal
By keeping this interface internal I was forced to re-create the interface (mostly) and create a wrapper around SerialDevice that implemented it.,Normal
That's a lot of code to write when the interface already exists.,Normal
After my application open office document programmatically in background link to it appears in Quick Access Area in File Explorer.,Normal

Since WebView lacks support for Manipulation Events it acts as a huge gesture eater which doesn't let its parent controls like ScrollViewer FlipView to take control of gesture like scroll swipe etc.,Normal
It becomes impossible to use a WebView along with other XAML Elements in the same view.,Normal
If SelectionMode is None in a ListView its really hard to know which item that is in focus.,Normal
Also setting which item is in focus is hard as well.,Normal
If there are some better way please let me know :).,Normal
The ways I found feels a bit clumsy.,Normal
I work around this by checking device family.,Normal
But the modern WinRT network API which is based around StreamSocket and the corresponding StreamSocketControl do not provide an option to enable TCP timestamps support.,Normal
Which is not future-proof.,Normal
Yes I know if we're C++ developers we can use the traditional Winsock API setsockopt() can do what we need but that will tied us to the old self-manage threads model which is not pleasing.,Normal

We want to tag the location but GPS takes longer than that to lock.,Normal
It's virtually impossible to tell how much you will be getting paid in paid apps and IAPs.,Normal
The reserved amount updates daily but that's never the actual number paid out.,Normal
For example if you see $800 in reserve there needs to be a way to know that you might expect about $500 of it to be paid while the rest is held over.,Suggestion
The UWP provides a couple of options to access files and folder:,Normal
Unfortunately access is ONLY guaranteed via StorageFile StorageFolder.,Normal
This makes it hard to port existing codes that make intensively use of the other API.,Normal
Right now attempt to do it using Win32 or stdio will result in Permission denied which is total nonsense; basically saying that OK we give you these API options but we dare you to try to use the classical one.,Normal
This will make it possible to have continuous deployment process for the platform.,Normal
Give the public yet another reason why the windows dev platform is the best.,Normal
Currently we customizing titlebar background and foreground but border is not.,Normal
Sometimes I only have a StorageFile and I would like to launch the Explorer to display that file.,Normal
To do so I need access to the file's StorageFolder and pass that to LaunchFolderAsync.,Normal

We do not use Basic authentication so cannot pass credentials on the url.,Normal
This means that we are forces to use the CodedUI framework.,Normal
Windows app store categories has tremendous potential to interact and request.,Normal
Scenario: we have a red that's an integral part of our identity.,Normal
Our users are asking for transparent tiles (including primary tile).,Normal
This leaves us in a bad place where we have to either sacrifice our branding or don't provide the required functionality,Normal
Proposed solution: have an independent color setting for Store-specific branding,Suggestion
Currently didn't support unicode.,Normal
I made a simple test code using KOREAN language.,Normal
And exception is raised.,Normal
If we look at .appx/the new installation mechanism as a much saner version of app installation then the more applications it allows the better.,Normal
My example: An interactive screen sharing app.,Normal
As far as I know this wouldn't be possible with Centennial as it exists today but these kinds of apps are still valuable.,Normal
Centennial takes big steps towards that but I'd like to go even further.,Normal
Not just 12 months.,Normal
I have a Style targeting a FontIcon control with a Setter for the FontFamily.,Normal
The open source platform IONIC has such a market place and I think it's great !,Normal
There exist a couple of UWP libraries  but their purpose is not to show beautifully designed apps implementing the material design principles of the framework.,Normal
As of now UIElement.Clip accepts only RectangleGeometry in UWP applications.,Normal
When UWP app has a Splash Screen with transparent background color declared in the app manifest desktop renders the accent color while phone renders the background color.,Normal
I belongs to India and want to register my self in Microsoft developer.,Normal
I need to pay life time registration fee for this.,Normal
when try to pay my fee there is only one option to make payment which is Credit Card.,Normal
No more options are there.,Normal
I do not have Credit Card therefore unable to make payment.,Normal
I have all these things but does not have only Credit Card and cause of only this minor reason I am unable to make payment.,Normal
When games get released on Steam Valve promotes the game for free by displaying it to 1 mln users.,Normal
Earlier there was option to cumulative download of all the app and now there is now way I can see total number of app downloads till date.,Normal
A report specially to know how many users have updated to a specific version of the App?,Normal
On some of my computers I only need the tools for phone deployment such as WinAppDeployCmd.,Normal
I don't code on all these machines I only need the tools!,Normal
I copied the tools out separately and they are only 106MB.,Normal
They work fine without the headers and libraries installed.,Normal
This feature is really usefull in messaging apps.,Normal
Is it the right place to report bugs to Microsoft?,Normal
Why do we need to call bug reports New Ideas?,Normal
(Administrator: I am listing this one as a bug because I consider it a existing security issue that can be exploited at present but please feel free to categorize it however you see fit as always!),Normal
Therefore malicious parties could use any URL/location they would like under their control for the WebAuthenticationBroker.Authenticate* calls to phish the credentials of users of this process as users do not see/understand the URL in which the process is loading the content for the authentication workflow and therefore cannot validate its authenticity.,Normal
For context here are the steps (as I understand them) that can be used to exploit this process:,Normal
That is where your creativity comes in!,Normal
If it works pass the user on to the real sign in page (or better yet simply set cookies on the user's session that makes it seem all is OK).,Suggestion
9) Rule planet Earth with your new-found powers (OK I made this one up :) ),Normal
For reference this is based on a thread started in the MSDN forums which you can see here for additional information:,Normal
Thank you for any consideration!,Normal
Adding developer revenue or IAP price info to response will allow developers to receive accurate data about their income in requested period.,Suggestion
So I can get the SID or the groups of the user.,Normal
Most companies want to control the access of the user by the active directory.,Normal
The enterprise application uses this information whether a user got access or not.,Normal
Please help us out!,Normal
We are an ISV who live in out of the United States.,Normal
When we want to set app price Dev Center offers by US Dolloar for base price.,Normal
(Previous version of dev center was able to set by local currency.,Normal
This is degraded.),Normal
USD is not familiar for us.,Normal
(We use different local currency basically.),Normal
There is no conversion list between USD and local currency.,Normal
Microsoft sometimes changes conversion rate due to foreign exchange conversion rate.,Normal
Because of this it is hard to find expected price by our local currency.,Normal
Conversion rate seems not constant because of this it is hard to find our expected price.,Normal
I have certificate in user storage and app storage with same issuer and subject but with different EKU fields.,Normal
Certificate in user storage is filtered out and that's the one I'm interested in.,Normal
I need to check if it's installed already or not and function checking it returned false because of this and I ended up installing new one every time.,Normal
And none of those duplicates are listed.,Normal
Today the UI designer could not work because it cannot parse the node.,Normal
Currently the rates/reviews user submitted in Win10 Insider Preview will be disabled later.,Normal
And if devs respond to that reviews it will also be deleted.,Normal
This is ridiculous behavior for both users and devs.,Normal
If MS will disable rates/reviews sent from Win10 IP disallow users to rate/review.,Normal
 Improvements to Windows Store apps and games visibility,Normal
Currently it is not possible to export the app download statistics automatically via an API in the Windows dev center.,Normal
Currently Microsoft doesn't have any specific support for beacons.,Normal
Beacons are the next generation rulers in the market.,Normal
As a windows developer I don't see a good future for windows here,Normal
When ever I contact any manufacturer of beacons they basically hesitate to support windows because the limitation in the windows featurest.,Normal
We don;t have any separate library for beacons.,Normal
Beacon also considered as normal bluetooth device.,Normal
Currently I can only read (that too has many limitations)  I can't communicate.,Normal
This is a big drawback.,Normal
We expected this will be solved in windows 10  but not yet.,Normal
Till now many clients for my company left out windows and they moved to iOS and Android.,Normal
If this is going to continue then windows will face huge drawback.,Normal
I have raised many questions related to this in community forum.,Normal
There was no input from there.,Normal
I'm not sure you guys will have a look on this quickly or not.,Normal
Even if you have a look I'm not sure about your priority.,Normal
Windows wings are currently cut down in this area.,Normal
In WPF you can use textures and patterns for your app background with the TileBrush class.,Normal
Since ImageBrush inherits from TileBrush there is a missed property: Tile.,Normal
In windows forms it is easy to have users print without a dialog and to code the printer output to use a specific paper bin.,Normal
This functionality is missing in UWP.,Normal
One of our applications has users print checks from a shared check printer with the check stock in tray 4.,Normal
700+ users as 52 sites do this and it has worked fine in VB6 for the last 16 years.,Normal
Now that we want to upgrade the applications to a modern environment we find that UWP does not do it and WPF makes it hard leaving only Winforms.,Normal
Right now you can not register them forever.,Normal
For example the PRO extension stands usually for a better version of the same app from the SAME DEVELOPER.,Normal
But if someone else uses this it is misleading.,Normal
I am working in multinational company,Normal
It is always the accent color and cannot be changed.,Normal
Currently the Windows Blog commenting system suffers from a myriad of problems:,Normal
Conversely with Disqus you get the following benefits:,Normal
A blog post has been created to discuss these issues at length and you can read that here:,Normal
Thank you for any consideration and dialogue around this idea!,Normal
This is ridiculous.,Normal
Also and perhaps more importantly developers need this!,Normal
Do you know how many hoops I have to jump though to make an app that simply takes photos and puts them on a network location... Too many.,Normal
It is crazy that such basic functionality is not currently supported almost every device on the planet supports this other than windows phone.,Normal
What makes this even more important is the fact that it IS already supported in UWP apps when they are running on desktop laptops and tablets.,Normal
But the same file picker on phone is just missing this Universal functionality...,Normal
I am having difficulty testing an In App Purchase that is successful with Microsoft's servers yet somehow my app never receives that success message.,Normal
We have made a private test app and we use real money to test IAP.,Normal
This makes it hard to test when there is a $ cost to every test we perform.,Normal
I would prefer to be able to test IAP hundreds of times without having to attempt to get a refund for thousands of dollars.,Suggestion
This is currently not possible to test using CurrentAppSimulator.,Normal
Apple and Google also provide such a sandbox environment where IAP does not cost real money.,Normal
I have a parent application that stores files within app space.,Normal
Now when I wish to open a file the launcher asks me to choose a target application.,Normal
MyApp has a file 'Abc.pdf'.,Normal
On opening the file Abc.pdf from MyApp the launcher provides a list of applications that can open this file.,Normal
Assuming i choose PDF Reader I want MyApp to know when PDF Reader has closed or stopped accessing my file i.e Abc.pdf,Normal
Code analysis will often warn if you expose a properlty as a uri using a string type (can be ignored but CA is giving a fair warning here I feel).,Normal
I would like to see System.Uri supported natively by the runtime when making a binding like this.,Suggestion
Also as a side note - the conversion from string breaks (throws an exception) if a bound string is null or empty - however a string that is non-empty and NOT a valid uri doesn't throw.,Normal
However if you have a PIN on your system it treats that as a biometric device as well.,Normal
This is not what the documentation indicates.,Normal
UserConsentVerifier should not treat a PIN as a biometric device.,Suggestion
Right now when displaying online web page in Windows 10 WebView the HSTS security feature is not working.,Normal
Also the WebView allows scripts from any source to load even though the page is loaded via HTTPS.,Normal
See these pages for testing HSTS and mixed content:,Normal
I need support for ios the actual app has a lot of problems,Normal
More like angularJs style.,Normal
The old one is to verbose.,Normal
Unfortunately the glyph activity is never displayed on the tile.,Normal
But when I'm using any other glyph (such as alarm alert attention) it is properly displayed.,Normal
Thanks and best regards,Normal
We are migrating an application from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.,Normal
The first problem that we encountred is that in WinRT enables to add an Service Reference of WCF and in UWP is not yet implemented.,Normal
Currently it's a mixture of some taxes are collected by MS some have to get paid by the developer.,Normal
As a smaller business this is a huge effort and only theoretically possible.,Normal
As far as I am informed the competition (Apple App Store Google Play) does this aswell.,Normal
Also MS used to collect more taxes than nowadays.,Normal
Look at this old feature request quoting an older Developer Agreement:,Normal
It states any current member country of the European Union which includes e.g.,Normal
Nowadays (Jan 13th 2016) the Dev Agreements lists Austria as a country which the developer has to collect the taxes:,Normal
Austria | Price being selected is the final sale price and includes any applicable taxes.,Normal
I need it to keep the app title bar background is the same with accent color.,Normal
On Windows 10 Mobile for mobile connections calling getSignalBars on a mobile connection always returns 5 even if the bars displayed by the system are any other value.,Normal
It's working on Wifi connection and on both type of connections on Windows 8.1.,Normal
Is this a bug or something changed in W10M ?,Normal
MAXPATH is giving me a severe headache lately!,Normal
I've been trying to compile some stuff and the compiler is necessarily creating processes with enormous arguments.,Normal
Everything would be fine but MAXPATH is too short to let it succeed!,Normal
This is the only reason I've got to switch to linux as I'm not in a position to change MAXPATH or rewrite the way the compiler calls processes.,Normal
PLEASE MICROSOFT HELP!,Normal
The generated bindings code is very large and not easy to follow.,Normal
Further it doesn't even exist until compilation and even then isn't visible to the user in VS.,Normal
Need timeout on read from StreamSocket just like with old .net sockets and serialport.,Suggestion
Now you have destroy the complete connection if a device on a Bluetooth serial connection does not respond.,Normal
While this makes no sense at all.,Normal
there nothing wrong with the connection it is just a serial device not responding.,Normal
Javascript provides a History API with which you can manipulation certain aspects of the browsing history.,Normal
For example history.replaceState() replaces the url of the current website in the browsing history.,Normal
However it is not possible to detect these changes in WebView without injecting javascript to replace the funtion calls.,Normal
This solution is quite hacky and a lot of work,Normal
About 90% of my apps can not be found in the store.,Normal
I have about 40 apps and around 8 are visible.,Normal
Even if I click on the developer name it still does not show all my apps.,Normal
If i do a deep link then yes it find the apps and you can download them but it wont find them with keywords or App Name.,Normal
This is the same issue for all Windows Stores.,Normal
Every version of Windows does not show my apps.,Normal
I actually had one of my apps appear and then disappear a day later.,Normal
This is unacceptable and is a strong deterrent to creating apps for Windows.,Normal
Phone 8.1 Phone 10 Windows 8 8.1 and Windows 10.,Normal
In-browser deployment was an excellent feature of Silverlight.,Normal
While most organizations will allow in-store apps it's still going to be very inconvenient to deploy apps through the app store for many reasons.,Normal
Firstly deployment in the app store requires rigorous testing etc. from Microsoft when the app users won't even be the general public.,Normal
Secondly we have many versions of the same application deployed to different customers.,Normal
"Read email access Locally is very important to create professional and amazing apps for UWP apps, please allow us to achieve this!",Suggestion
We need set it in codes.,Normal
http request includes get or post request(url and body),Normal
While android and ios can do it.,Normal
After changing to fullscreen and back the position of the window is wrong and not to influence right?,Normal
I just found that reading the property of System.Comment from a file doesn't work on Windows 10.,Normal
I used StorageFile.Properties.GetDocumentPropertiesAsync() to read the properties of a file that has Comment but DocumentProperties.Comment is a empty string.,Normal
Same problem happens to windows explorer set a new comment then apply to the file but when you read again there's nothing!,Normal
Currently Windows OS decides the best Internet connection and uses it automatically (If I have more than one connection like WiFi and Network cable).,Normal
UWP still lags all features of regular ADO to connect to any DB.,Normal
Using EF6/7 will only provide direct access to SqlLite and not regular DBs.,Normal
MS shall change EF7 to allow DB connectivity via batch data return like 50/100 return records at a time instead of SELECT * returning entire DB-Table data in one shot.,Suggestion
It appears there is a Enter File Name even when selecting an existing file using FileSavePicker on UWP mobile.,Normal
It seems to work as expected on desktop.,Normal
You can see my original question on MSDN forum below.,Normal
Winjs was designed prior to ES6.,Normal
Some of the capabilities are now provided by ES6 such as classses would not have to be provided by winjs.,Normal
Edge Browser VS 2015 and VS Code already provides support for ES6.,Normal
Unfortunately it is also bug-infested and lacks fundamental features expected from a graphical debugging tool in 2015.,Normal
The solution is open-sourcing WinDbg and related tools (dbghlp WinDbg extensions etc. ) which will allow the community to fix and improve what the rather small team at Microsoft doesn't manage to.,Suggestion
At the moment it is impractical for me as a developer to keep asking my boss for his Microsoft account just to create app packages.,Normal
I have posted my 1st application on windows store with 9 keywords.,Normal
For eg in publisher name or in application name whole word partial word and so on.,Normal
The App knows that it is a totaly new/clear situation,Normal
scenario: user save a file app is closed directory is deleted/renamed next time: Dlg Save file:,Normal
Currently it's difficult to do some of these things.,Normal
Nesting UIContainers inside of a RichTextBlock to add border elements needed for this ruins the alignment of text.,Normal
Inexplicably the UWP does not include the WPF WrapPanel that was introduced nearly 10 years ago.,Normal
There are other panels in the UWP that do something similar like the WrapGrid but this doesnt work well if the items are variable size.,Normal
One simple example where the WrapPanel is essential is when displaying a “tag cloud”.,Normal
There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio.,Normal
Without that we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator.,Normal
Oddly with Windows 8.1 tooling installed and Windows 10 SDK we can actually see the list of Windows 10 emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output (and need to do some post-filtering to separate the 8.1 and 10 emulators).,Normal
So currently we can use the 8.1 tooling to get the list of emulators but if we try to deploy to them they'll start up but app deployment will fail.,Normal
Today I opened the Windows Dev account Payout report  I found up my advertising and my purchased app already separate into two?,Normal
Why this happen?,Normal
I developed the app bizview a Google Analytics client with the same features of Official Google Analytics app in the Android Store.,Normal
This question is not because bizview is my own app the question is for all developers that works hard.,Normal
After some diagnosis I found that the issue is caused by the API not handling PDF files encrypted with AES 256 Encryption that the later acrobat versions use.,Normal
When drag/dropping files/folders onto Universal Apps the read-only attribute is set making it impossible to edit those files/folders.,Normal
After all drag/drop is a conscious user interaction (like a picker) and does not happen without their knowledge.,Normal
APIs do not support the configuration of the window background colour.,Normal
This means that if like Groove (Music) an app uses a non-white background a noticable section of white appears when a window is dragged to a new size.,Normal
The link above is a Sway that explains my suggestion better than i can do so here.,Normal
I sincerely hope it makes a difference,Normal
Unfortunately neither the SmartCard class nor the SmartCardProvisioning class (nor any other related class) provides a means of retrieving the friendly name later.,Normal

It is frustrated for a devoloper then an app is'nt Show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by Name.,Suggestion
I have released several versions of the app yet I cannot find the number of new users or the number of existing users who have upgraded to the new app version in the DEV center.,Normal
I hope I can set my App price is $0.2 but I can't now.,Normal
Currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using ScheduledToastNotification.,Normal
But this is simply not an elegant solution...,Normal
All Win32 Mac Linux have API's to do so but UWP doesn't.,Normal
When you have a text editor with unsaved changes the standard behavior is to ask the user what to do before closing.,Normal
This is not possible on UWP.,Normal
Today I have run into a problem with ComboBox control.,Normal
The issue can be easily reproduced:,Normal
I have two rows and two columns.,Normal
Left column takes as much space as possible and I place the ComboBox into the right column.,Normal
I populate the ComboBox with a few items and run the app.,Normal
I maximize the window open the ComboBox popup (selection menu) minimize and I see the popup moved to the middle of the window.,Normal
ShowAt show the flyout with the size (width) defined in the style,Normal
However ShowAtAsync show the flyout with the with of the element passed in parameter and ignore the style.,Normal
I think its a bug.,Normal
I would prefer it return a boolean or an enum with the Fail reason.,Suggestion
Probably when the location is outside the camera frustum...,Normal
Currently we have to test if the returned points is inside the rect with a size of map.ActualWidth and map.ActualHeight.,Normal
If the point is outside we have to divide the result by RawPixelsPerViewPixel.,Normal
a point with a location near the top right corner of the map and inside the map will have an offset of 3190,Normal
if the location is slightly on the right the returned point will be 4810 instead of 3210 (you have to divide it by a factor of 1.5 on my Lumia 635).,Normal
This can be seen in settings page.,Normal
Some apps don't work in background well.,Normal
Downloads may breaks when apps switched.,Normal
Currently when the publisher name is chosen during signup a publisher id is derived from that.,Normal
This publisher id is then used to name the app packages and the apps LocalStorage folder.,Normal
If you are careless during signup you are stuck and can't change the publisher id and therefore that naming of your packages.,Normal

Why can i NOT assign to-run-application for some SCREEN-REGION on locked screen...?,Normal
Home automation is a huge market for Windows devices.,Normal
A big piece of this is being able to monitor/control IP Cameras such as the Foscam HD cameras.,Normal
Right now we can only inspect the server certificate after a request was done by using 'RequestMessage.TransportInformation'.,Normal
But unfortunately this is application wide and so all certificates of all services of websites that might be called in the app must be included.,Normal
Seems like there is a problem with a popup which seems to overlap the application bar.,Normal
The strange is that when we open the appbar it seems to be partially covered.,Normal
I've observed it on bot - desktop and mobile UWP app.,Normal

This feature is available on Android (I heard even on iPhone),Normal
Since the above code does not set a well known header the above code results in an exception: Misused header name.,Normal
My company and thousands of others use Sketch to develop app interfaces that we then give to our developers.,Normal
There is currently no way how to display in WebView HTTPS web page with invalid certificate even with user specific opt-in.,Normal
Currently there is no such provision and all of employees who are coding and publishing apps easily know the revenue earned.,Normal
More I earn more chances they will leave and start publishing their own apps.,Normal
Both Apple and Google allows us to create user accounts with release manager role who has no access to sales/revenue reports.,Normal
In Windows 10 Mobile any third-party app can act as a Caller-ID app to intercept the call and set the PhoneCallOrigin.,Normal
But other apps cannot access PhoneCallOrigin from PhoneCallHistoryEntry.,Normal
When developing Coded UI test for a localized UWP apps test becomes dependent on texts that are localized.,Normal
On most controls this can easily be handled by an AutomationId but on the CoreWindow and MessageBox (incl. buttons) you cannot set any AutomationId’s so the coded UI test has the use the title to find the elements.,Normal
I've two apps with same name one is in phone and the other one is in desktop.,Normal
Now I created a universal app.,Normal
Tab version have a small number of users I need to upload new universal package to the phone version app.,Normal
But the problem is the App name automatically reserved to the Tab version and the package name also.,Normal
I'm not able to associate the application with the phone build in the store(because the app name is not reserved to this there is no package name or package id for this in the store),Normal
How can I resolve this issue without changing the name of the Phone Build.,Normal
See below the template of my button and the two different renderings.,Normal
Other strange differences did show up as well - especially in Grids - but the example above is the craziest one.,Normal
Please tell me if you want some details about other mismatches.,Normal
I've developed application which targets Windows Phone 8.0.,Normal
When XAP is deployed on Win10 Mobile device it has some strange bug.,Normal
After re-installing the app (uninstall - deploy) Application's Data stays the same - it isn't removed after unstalling the app.,Normal

Remote Desktop Services objects for Windows Store apps are no longer available for use as of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview.,Normal
Negative reviews are bad especially when users rated an old version of the app which will then turn down new users.,Normal
Back in Windows Phone 8.0 Silverlight-times I was able to get the content of the CameraRoll much faster (via the MediaLibrary <1 second for the same amount of files).,Normal
How can it be that this became so extremely slow with the UAP?,Normal
In Silverlight it was once possible to register an app as an option for the edit picker in the photo hub (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj662932(v=vs.105).aspx).,Normal
This is not possbile for UAP apps.,Normal
This option is already present in the desktop variant of the app but missing in the mobile app.,Normal
The equivalent WinRT API - MessageDialog - provides no apparent means to copy the message to clipboard - no response to right click no response to Ctrl+C.,Normal
