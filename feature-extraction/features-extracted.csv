35,MR. ALLEN,"chairman, mr.",False,False,False,Neutral,2
35,MR. ALLEN,"allen think we need to decide on this, this one at this meeting today, because there is a wage survey that's scheduled for august, which is not such a big deal, as long as we have a recommendation from the committee on what to do with the employees, because there is currently no capability of conducting a local wage survey in that wage area.",True,True,False,Negative,1

41,MR. ALLEN,"allen think what we're really looking at is proximity, and mr.",False,False,False,Negative,1
41,MR. ALLEN,allen think we really do need to stick with the concept that proximity is really what drives the need to define areas of application for nonappropriated fund wage areas.,False,False,False,Negative,1
42,MR.

49,MR. ELDER,elder do have a question.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
50,MR. ELDER,at what point do you use to measure the proximity?.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
51,MR. ELDER,how do you measure that from burlington county to chester county?.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
52,MR. ALLEN,"it's measured from the location where the main employment location is, so it's measured from coatesville, pennsylvania, which is in chester county.",False,False,False,Negative,1
53,MR. ALLEN,that's the location of the va medical center that's there.,False,False,False,Neutral,2

55,MR. ELDER,"so, mr.",False,False,False,Neutral,2
55,MR. ELDER,"elder mean, it would seem, given what was proposed, the proposal was to move philadelphia and montgomery county into burlington and retain new castle in the burlington area.",False,False,False,Negative,1
56,MR. ELDER,"it would seem, just from looking at the map, chester county is at least as close to burlington as new castle.",False,False,False,Negative,1
57,MR. ELDER,"so it doesn't make sense to define chester into a county to the west, to the southwest, with a smaller population than defining a county to the west into the larger population and larger area containing philadelphia and burlington.",False,False,False,Negative,1
58,MR. ELDER,it would seem to mr.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
58,MR. ELDER,elder this particular area should be defined into burlington.,False,False,False,Negative,1
59,MR. ELDER,mr.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
59,MR. ELDER,"elder mean, if you're putting philadelphia into this wage area, philadelphia would seem to shift the center of the burlington wage area, the center of their's employment, west toward chester county, whereas before the center of the burlington wage area , the center of their employment might have been further east in burlington county.",False,False,False,Negative,1
60,CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN,what page is the map that you're referring to?.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
61,MR. ELDER,it's a part of 564-mgt-3.,False,True,True,Neutral,2

65,MR. ALLEN,okay.,False,False,False,Positive,3
66,MR. ALLEN,"what the management proposal does is the management proposal looks at each county in the current montgomery wage area, and the management proposal looks at the opm regulatory criteria generally.",False,False,False,Negative,1
67,MR. ALLEN,"the first criterion looked at is proximity, and mr.",False,False,False,Positive,3
67,MR. ALLEN,allen think the committee has agreed the committee's the primary criterion to look at.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
68,MR. ALLEN,"the other criteria are actually kind of indeterminate, and the primary reason that the management proposal recommends moving chester county to the harford wage area is proximity from the location where the employees work at the va medical center in chester county to the host installation for the harford wage area, which is aberdeen proving ground.",False,False,False,Negative,1
69,MR. ELDER,right.,False,False,False,Positive,3
70,MR. ELDER,mr.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
70,MR. ELDER,"elder mean, that still doesn't address the point that mr.",False,False,False,Negative,1
70,MR. ELDER,"elder made just a moment ago that philadelphia should really be considered more of the center now, given the new boundaries of this wage area.",False,False,False,Positive,3
71,MR. ELDER,"it should really be considered the center for the definition of the burlington area, and burlington would move burlington closer to chester county and move a larger number of employees, mr.",False,False,False,Positive,3
71,MR. ELDER,"elder'm sure, than are in the harford area.",False,False,False,Neutral,2
72,MR. ELDER,so that would further weight the distribution toward moving chester into the burlington wage area.,False,False,False,Negative,1
73,MR. ALLEN,"actually, what would happen is the city of philadelphia would not be surveyed any longer, because there would be too few nonappropriated fund employees there to support a separate wage survey.",True,False,False,Negative,1
74,MR. ALLEN,"the center of that wage area actually shifts over to burlington county, which is why the distances are measured from what would be each area of application county to the closest survey area, which is the reason why we're recommending that chester county be part of the harford wage area.",False,False,False,Negative,1
75,MR. ALLEN,"when we look at distance, mr.",False,False,False,Neutral,2
75,MR. ALLEN,"allen think it's something like 48 miles to harford county and 78 miles to burlington, so it's sort of skipping over philadelphia because the labor market in philadelphia for nonappropriated fund employment and the way that the wage schedule is determined, is actually no longer relevant to how pay is set in that wage area.",True,True,True,Negative,1
76,MR. ELDER,"philadelphia seems like an awfully strange place to just skip over, but for these purposes -- but what about new castle county?.",False,False,False,Negative,1
77,MR. ELDER,that is also in the burlington area.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
78,MR. ELDER,how do you justify leaving chester out while leaving new castle in the burlington area?.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
79,MR. ALLEN,there was a review of new castle county some years ago.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
80,MR. ALLEN,mr.,False,False,False,Neutral,2

81,MR. ELDER,parts of new castle seem to be further from the center of burlington than chester.,False,False,False,Negative,1
82,MR. ELDER,that's mr.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
82,MR. ELDER,elder's main concern there.,False,False,False,Neutral,2
83,MR. ALLEN,"what we have been seeing with nonappropriated fund wage areas is that there have been multiple abolishments of wage areas over the years as bases have closed, so i can't really claim that every county that's currently defined, if you look at it on the map, that it makes absolute sense if you're looking at patterns with these things, but there was a rationale at some point for fprac to recommend that opm define the counties in a certain way.",False,False,False,Verynegative,0

103,MR.
