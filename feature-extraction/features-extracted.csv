35,MR. ALLEN,"chairman, mr.",Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
35,MR.

41,MR. ALLEN,allen think we really do need to stick with the concept that proximity is really what drives the need to define areas of application for nonappropriated fund wage areas.,Task Assigned,False,False,False,Negative,1

50,MR. ELDER,at what point do you use to measure the proximity?.,Interrogative-what,False,False,False,Neutral,2
51,MR. ELDER,how do you measure that from burlington county to chester county?.,Interrogative-unknown,False,False,False,Neutral,2
52,MR. ALLEN,"it's measured from the location where the main employment location is, so it's measured from coatesville, pennsylvania, which is in chester county.",Task Assigned,False,False,False,Negative,1
53,MR. ALLEN,that's the location of the va medical center that's there.,Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2

55,MR. ELDER,"so, mr.",Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
55,MR. ELDER,"elder mean, it would seem, given what was proposed, the proposal was to move philadelphia and montgomery county into burlington and retain new castle in the burlington area.",Task Assigned,False,False,False,Negative,1
56,MR. ELDER,"it would seem, just from looking at the map, chester county is at least as close to burlington as new castle.",Task Assigned,False,False,False,Negative,1
57,MR. ELDER,"so it doesn't make sense to define chester into a county to the west, to the southwest, with a smaller population than defining a county to the west into the larger population and larger area containing philadelphia and burlington.",Normal,False,False,False,Negative,1
58,MR. ELDER,it would seem to mr.,Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
58,MR. ELDER,elder this particular area should be defined into burlington.,Normal,False,False,False,Negative,1
59,MR. ELDER,mr.,Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
59,MR. ELDER,"elder mean, if you're putting philadelphia into this wage area, philadelphia would seem to shift the center of the burlington wage area, the center of their's employment, west toward chester county, whereas before the center of the burlington wage area , the center of their employment might have been further east in burlington county.",Suggestion,False,False,False,Negative,1
60,CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN,what page is the map that you're referring to?.,Interrogative-what,False,False,False,Neutral,2

67,MR. ALLEN,allen think the committee has agreed the committee's the primary criterion to look at.,Task Assigned,False,False,False,Neutral,2
68,MR. ALLEN,"the other criteria are actually kind of indeterminate, and the primary reason that the management proposal recommends moving chester county to the harford wage area is proximity from the location where the employees work at the va medical center in chester county to the host installation for the harford wage area, which is aberdeen proving ground.",Normal,False,False,False,Negative,1
69,MR. ELDER,right.,Normal,False,False,False,Positive,3
70,MR. ELDER,mr.,Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
70,MR. ELDER,"elder mean, that still doesn't address the point that mr.",Normal,False,False,False,Negative,1
70,MR. ELDER,"elder made just a moment ago that philadelphia should really be considered more of the center now, given the new boundaries of this wage area.",Task Assigned,False,False,False,Positive,3
71,MR. ELDER,"it should really be considered the center for the definition of the burlington area, and burlington would move burlington closer to chester county and move a larger number of employees, mr.",Normal,False,False,False,Positive,3
71,MR. ELDER,"elder'm sure, than are in the harford area.",Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
72,MR. ELDER,so that would further weight the distribution toward moving chester into the burlington wage area.,Task Assigned,False,False,False,Negative,1
73,MR. ALLEN,"actually, what would happen is the city of philadelphia would not be surveyed any longer, because there would be too few nonappropriated fund employees there to support a separate wage survey.",Task Assigned,True,False,False,Negative,1
74,MR.

75,MR. ALLEN,"when we look at distance, mr.",Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
75,MR. ALLEN,"allen think it's something like 48 miles to harford county and 78 miles to burlington, so it's sort of skipping over philadelphia because the labor market in philadelphia for nonappropriated fund employment and the way that the wage schedule is determined, is actually no longer relevant to how pay is set in that wage area.",Normal,True,True,True,Negative,1

82,MR. ELDER,that's mr.,Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
82,MR. ELDER,elder's main concern there.,Normal,False,False,False,Neutral,2
83,MR.
